Otherwise, the physician may have no chance to counter any misinformation, or worse, any dangerous health practices (like vaccine refusal) that their patients might adopt.
Some patients will not be persuaded, of course. But many will hopefully be willing to listen to their physician, especially if they feel that their questions are welcomed and that they won‚Äôt be scolded for readong online info.

","<p>Like it or not, I think physicians need to start being proactive and ask their patients whether they&#8217;re researching medical issues online, and encouraging a discussion about what they&#8217;re reading. Otherwise, the physician may have no chance to counter any misinformation, or worse, any dangerous health practices (like vaccine refusal) that their patients might adopt.</p>
<p>Some patients will not be persuaded, of course. But many will hopefully be willing to listen to their physician, especially if they feel that their questions are welcomed and that they won&#8217;t be scolded for readong online info. </p>

Cat, you are so right! If it were not for the internet I would be lost. My son Brad has had so many fantastic treatments and supplements since I was able to do online research for my own on what helps autism, and not bother with those silly cautions from my doctors to be careful what I read. Honestly you think they‚Äôd be afraid I might find something harmful using Google ‚Ä¶as if! Why they think I might not be able to judge the relative merits of all these different sources of information about autism I haven‚Äôt the faintest idea. I mean, it‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt got 11th grade math or anything, because I have!
Just look at a few of the wonderful remedies we have been able to get for Brad recently ‚Äì There was that stem cell therapy in Tijuana which I would never have been able to find if I hadn‚Äôt seen it on the Natural News website. Totally ace! I know the cost is rather prohibitive, but what‚Äôs $50k when it comes down to getting your child back? I think the benefits are even greater than we got with that course of chelation last year, although it‚Äôs so hard to tell, since Brad doesn‚Äôt seem to say much to us anymore since that first series of stem cell lumbar punctures. But at least with the Lupron protocol we won‚Äôt have to worry about him getting some poor girl pregnant in a few years ‚Äì now that‚Äôs a relief I can tell you, what with that trouble we had with Savannah last year!
But I must let you know about what must be the best treatment so far, which I would never have known about without the meticulous online research I did on your AoA website. Yup, it‚Äôs that MMS stuff, the perfectly harmless supplement to give your autistic child. All it takes is regular enemas of something that sounds a bit like it could be bleach but it is so totally not (I mean is table salt the same as chlorine gas?  Absolutely no way!!!).  And as soon as Brad gets out of intensive care I am sure he will start enjoying the benefits of it, as long as I can convince him to let me stick those enema tubes up him again. I know he cries a lot, but it‚Äôs all for his own good obviously, not mine!
Like you, I‚Äôm constantly on the internet.  And like you, everyone I know relies on the information they find online for some reason or another.  I mean, who would have possibly known Obama wasn‚Äôt born in the USA if it hadn‚Äôt been for the internet! Every day I count my blessings, and one day Brad will count them too in the future. I just have to hope we have enough money left to get there! But I don‚Äôt want to end by leaving you thinking I am so gullible that I believe everything I see online. For example only last week I read someone say that Mark Geier had his license suspended in yet another State. As if that could be even vaguely true, huh? The guy is a hero, and no one could possibly believe some ridiculous internet propaganda, could they? Well not me anyway!

Vitamins and the like give the illusion of control, but the reality is we are always at risk, and pretending organic food is medicine while opposing vaccination (and confusing vaccines with antibiotics) doesn‚Äôt make those risks go away.

"343926","163","155430",,"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/quackery-then-and-now/",,"Just to clarify, I took approximately 1000mg Vitamin C for 5 years and average 2000mg when I was sick, and I was sick on several occasions, ranging from throat infection to fever/vomiting to head cold symptoms.  I was also pretty scrupulous about organic food and free range/humanely treated, non-antibiotics treated/non-hormone treated meats.  Some ten years after dropping all these habits, I can assure you my health hasn‚Äôt changed much at all.
My point is not that my experience disproves yours, but that it doesn‚Äôt prove anything.  If I were a doctor, should I start telling everyone to stop taking vitamins and eating organic food because in my experience it didn‚Äôt do anything?  It‚Äôs the same evidence that you have, but even I wouldn‚Äôt think it was an example for anyone else.  Why is that?
The purpose of a clinical trial is to combine many people‚Äôs experiences to see what applies to everyone.  You find clinical trials that show extra vitamins help sickness, someone else finds trials that show the opposite.  Can we agree that one of the trials has to be wrong?  How can we tell which one is better, which one can be trusted?
And notice your website talks about placebos, but placebo effects are relatively minor compared to all the other things that happen in a person life that might effect their health positively.  Much more important is that people often can‚Äôt be sure about what the real cause for something is; if I do a dance before it rains, did my dance cause the rain? (I hope we can agree the answer is no).
You get better after taking vitamins and organic food, but are they both responsible or is one more important?  Did you change anything else in your life?  More exercise? Less exercise? Did you move to a new place or home?  Spend more time outside?  Do you pay attention to your food more than you did before?  Do you eat healthier (more fruits and veggies) now that you eat only organic foods?  I‚Äôm not asking for answers, but couldn‚Äôt any one of these things also have improved your health.
All of these things apply to my experience with vitamins/organic food as well, regardless of the answers; they apply to everyone who is making a health claim they want other people to take seriously.  If we can‚Äôt rule out other causes then from a scientific perspective everything else is just a guess.  It might be a guess that conforms to your experience, but it‚Äôs still a guess.
","<p>Just to clarify, I took approximately 1000mg Vitamin C for 5 years and average 2000mg when I was sick, and I was sick on several occasions, ranging from throat infection to fever/vomiting to head cold symptoms.  I was also pretty scrupulous about organic food and free range/humanely treated, non-antibiotics treated/non-hormone treated meats.  Some ten years after dropping all these habits, I can assure you my health hasn&#8217;t changed much at all.</p>
<p>My point is not that my experience disproves yours, but that it doesn&#8217;t prove anything.  If I were a doctor, should I start telling everyone to stop taking vitamins and eating organic food because in my experience it didn&#8217;t do anything?  It&#8217;s the same evidence that you have, but even I wouldn&#8217;t think it was an example for anyone else.  Why is that?</p>
<p>The purpose of a clinical trial is to combine many people&#8217;s experiences to see what applies to everyone.  You find clinical trials that show extra vitamins help sickness, someone else finds trials that show the opposite.  Can we agree that one of the trials has to be wrong?  How can we tell which one is better, which one can be trusted?</p>
<p>And notice your website talks about placebos, but placebo effects are relatively minor compared to all the other things that happen in a person life that might effect their health positively.  Much more important is that people often can&#8217;t be sure about what the real cause for something is; if I do a dance before it rains, did my dance cause the rain? (I hope we can agree the answer is no).</p>
<p>You get better after taking vitamins and organic food, but are they both responsible or is one more important?  Did you change anything else in your life?  More exercise? Less exercise? Did you move to a new place or home?  Spend more time outside?  Do you pay attention to your food more than you did before?  Do you eat healthier (more fruits and veggies) now that you eat only organic foods?  I&#8217;m not asking for answers, but couldn&#8217;t any one of these things also have improved your health.</p>

The article is actually decently written, though obviously written by someone who really doesn‚Äôt have one single clue about medicine or biology. 
I would say that roughly 80% of the piece is pretty spot on and reasonably written. There are a few bad assumptions and that led to the (partly) incorrect conclusion at the end. 
The first part I take issue with is this common dietetic trope:
All animals have an evolutionary niche and we should try to stay within it, said Smith. Ginna was impressed
Yes, that is true‚Ä¶ to an extent. The two things that are very important and never considered by people making such statement are that a niche is rarely so incredibly specific and it assumes that evolution has stopped at some arbitrary point depending on what the person is trying to hawk. 
For the first point, relatively few examples of such highly specific ecological/dietary niches exist in the animal world. By limiting what energy sources are useable a species would make itself much easier to go extinct should an ecological change make that particular food less available. Having the ability to successfully use a wide range of energy sources makes a species more evolutionarily robust. I agree that species will thrive better on different percentages of intake of certain foods ‚Äì cats should have more meat for example. But to tie that in with gluten enteropathy (the general term for celiac‚Äôs disease) makes no sense and is completely incidental.
The second point is key here as well and many smart people completely fail to understand it. Michio Kaku, a brilliant theoretical physicist, was widely ridiculed in the evo bio community for his video talking about how humans have stopped evolving. We haven‚Äôt. Not by a long shot. 
So having an arbitrary point at which ‚Äúwe evolved‚Äù and deciding whatever foods were prevalent at those times are the ‚Äúbest‚Äù for us makes no sense. Furthermore, the secondarily implicit assumption there is that the predominant food at the time was actually even the best for us at the time ‚Äì it may have merely been all that was available for myriad reasons and we just barely subsisted on it! That seems much more plausible to me.
The other big flaw of this piece is the misattribution. Gluten enteropathy is a disease of hyperactive immunity ‚Äì the same as any allergic reaction. People who tend to have hyperactive immune systems also tend to have more types of allergies as well as autoimmune disease ‚Äì the two processes are connected at the basic cellular level. Without going into odious detail, I‚Äôll leave it to say that all the autoimmune diseases that Gail suffered are all known to be fundamentally connected through a complex genetic predisposition. Having a hyperactive immune system also leads to immune complexes (the IgA stuff amongst others ‚Äì IgG, IgM, IgE) circulating in the blood. This deposits in the kidneys and causes them to decrease in function. Removing the source of the aggravation to the immune system (in this case the gluten) means less circulating immune complexes, which means that the deposition process can be reversed, and the kidney function can return to varying degrees. This is all to be expected and quite reasonably understood by medical science (though many of exact specifics are yet to be elucidated, the basic processes involved are well validated and understood). 
In other words, yes, gluten free certainly helped this woman in many ways. But that was only because she had gluten enteropathy. The article clearly implies that anyone would be similarly helped by a gluten free (or ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù) diet. This is not true. It would be like saying that someone who is allergic to milk gets better after stopping drinking milk, therefore everyone should stop drinking milk to get better. And all built on a few flimsy premises and a lack of recognizing the underlying unifying concepts.
For a bit of a better article about the Quantified Self aspect of it, I would direct you to this article. I will be upfront that a friend of mine is the lead author on the piece and I helped him edit it, but he is very much into the QS idea and takes an (IMHO) appropriately skeptical outlook on it and discussion of its limitations.
Lastly, I‚Äôll say that the article was not only written by someone without any relevant background, but apparently very quickly as well. If you notice in the last paragraph GFR becomes a typo ‚Äì GFK.

To address that specific quote, what if the studies that agree with you are wrong?

Again, how do I choose between two studies that get opposite results?  You‚Äôre saying, whichever matches my experience.

If a study is judged only by whether its results agree with out experience, then don‚Äôt we know the answer beforehand?  There are ways to determine whether a trial is fair or not‚Ä¶please see the scientific method.
As for my vitamin box, it includes an essential oils mixture (which includes flax) and a specific omega 3 pill bottle that tastes like fish when I burp.  But I repeat, my experience is not important nor am I telling you about it to convince you of anything about vitamins or organic food.  You can spend all your life trying to figure out the difference between your experience and someone else‚Äôs and never get it right, our lives are complicated and full of changes we don‚Äôt pay enough attention to.

"343977","163","141370",,"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/quackery-then-and-now/",,"William, again..look at the dangers of what conventional meds are doing first.
First:
You say ‚Äúlook at the dangers of what conventional meds are doing first‚Äù.  Wrong.  One must first look at the dangers of not giving the medications, and then decide if the adverse effects are worth the risk.  
As has been repeated many, many times, one must consider the benefits of drugs as well as their risks.  Heparin is dangerous and can lead to bleeding out ‚Äì but can also disrupt clots that cause strokes.  And I‚Äôd rather not die of a stroke if I have the choice.  Whenever some knee-jerk critic of drugs and ‚ÄúBig Pharma‚Äù points out drugs have risks (a not-trivial but certainly not surprising fact), they consistently ignore that drugs are given for a reason.  Perhaps your doctor is different, but I have never been handed a drug and told to take it unless it was to address a medical complaint.  Does your doctor‚Äôs office simply hand out prescriptions without an appointment?  If so, you should report them to the appropriate medical supervisory body for malpractice.  You could also try a class-action lawsuit since that‚Äôs pretty blatant malpractice.
Second:
There is a rigorous system of evaluation and safety testing designed to establish the effectiveness, adverse effects and therapeutic window of drugs.  The result is a general awareness of what a drug is good for, at what dose, and what adverse effects are dangerous versus merely annoying.  There‚Äôs a packaging insert included with all drugs indicating what adverse effects to look out for.  And for medications with serious risks and a narrow window of safety (of which there generally are not many, and which would be restricted for use only in extreme situations such as cancer or immediate death) your doctor and probably pharmacist will brief you on what to expect and look out for.  Each treatment, drug, surgical or otherwise, will have a unique set of risks and benefits, so lumping them all into a single category is flat-out wrong.  Some molecules should be approved, some should, and some are equivocal.  Pretending they are all vicious poisons is absurd (particularly coming from someone who doesn‚Äôt seem to appreciate the dangers of hypervitaminosis.
Third:
Your recommendations are aimed at the wrong person as I do not take any chronic medications.  I follow my doctor‚Äôs advice to eat whole foods, exercise and get enough sleep.  My cholesterol, blood pressure and other indicators of basic good health are quite good.  So please keep your advice to yourself, it is unwanted, inaccurate and misguided.  Of the three minor health complaints I have had in the past year, one required no medication and the second resolved with minor discomfort after following my doctor‚Äôs recommendations and the third vanished within three days of starting antibiotics.  I‚Äôll trust him, because if I compare my choices (on one hand, a doctor with up to 15 years of schooling and decades of practice, drawing upon the lessons of thousands of very, very smart scientists and practitioners using methods designed to reduce bias and improve the chance of arriving at a correct answer; on the other hand, someone whose qualifications appear to be ‚Äúliving in the country‚Äù, ‚Äúthinks vitamins are magic‚Äù and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know the definition of ‚Äòchemical‚Äô or ‚Äòtoxin'‚Äù) I‚Äôm going to go with my doctor.  Because I want to live a long, healthy life.
Responding to my points about the dangers of confirmation bias with a comment about the dangers of prescription medication is a complete non sequiter.

"343973","163","148527",,"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-swiss-report-on-homeopathy/",,"It is rather strange to call this a Swiss government report. In the course of an evaluation of five alternative treatments which were being reimbursed by the Swiss public health insurance, several groups submitted reports. The Shang et al. paper (2005) was one of these reports. This book (published in German and in Germany in 2006) was another. The total result is that the Swiss government stopped the reimbursement. Only later a referendum made them reinstate it, and another round of evaluation will taken place in the future.
The present English book is an updated (mainly with criticism of Shang et al.) version of the 2006 book.
You can read more about it in a critique by Edzard Ernst in the online FACT:
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2042-7166.2012.01160.x/full
Ernst mostly looked at chapter 9, but I have been looking at chapter 10. Here is a summary of what I found. 
Chapter 10 ‚Äì written by six authors, five of whom are homeopaths ‚Äì collects 29 studies in ‚ÄòUpper Respiratory Tract Infections/AllergicReactions‚Äô (URTI/A). This number is surprisingly small. I found 161 such studies by a cursory internet search. The authors managed to miss 25 studies that had been mentioned in earlier meta-analyses. Their investigation seem to have been a haste job, as they claimed lack of time for 5 studies. They included a study of what appears to be a single case of infectious mononucleosis (their number 12). They included one study (their number 4) but missed the one by the same principal author immediately preceding it in the same journal. They missed a Mexican paper (River√≥n-Garrote et al. 1998 [2]) that ‚Äòproved‚Äô homeopathy effective for asthma with p=0.00000000001 by my estimate. So the whole selection is haphazard and sloppy.
As small studies are unreliable and anything not a double blind RCT cannot be taken serious in homeopathy, I restricted my attention to the 11 placebo controlled double blind RCTs with more than 50 patients. 
Two of these are large Oscillococcinum trials. These must be considered as dubious. The first one by Ferley et al. (1989) [3] selected of all patients with flu-like symptoms only the few that recovered in 48 hours, which happened to be the only possibility out of 14 yielding a statistically significant (correctly computed: p=0.0494) result. This can at best be considered an exploratory result of the weakest kind. A follow-up study was done (Papp et al. 1998, not in Pubmed [4]) in which the Ferley hypothesis was tested by a group led by Philippe Belon, research director of the manufacturer of Oscillococcinum. The null hypothesis could not be rejected (p=0.4). However, this result was not mentioned at all. Instead an undocumented test, the Krauth test, was said to yield p=0.0028. No details were given. 
The other nine (in chronological order the numbers 8, 6, 10, 1, 4, 22, 24, 25, 29 in chapter 10) can all be found in Pubmed, and except number 6 (Reilly et al. 1986 [5]) they all returned a negative verdict: not significant, not effective, no clinical relevance, no evidence etc. The 30 per cent dropout rate in Reilly‚Äôs paper doesn‚Äôt inspire much confidence. But according to the authors of chapter 10, the majority (five out of nine) were in favour of homeopathy. An example is the research by my compatriot Elly de Lange (number 1 in chapter 10). She treated 175 kids (among whom 5 dropouts) each for a full year with classical homeopathy and for a condition (URTI) reputed to be eminently treatable by homeopathy. She found that her placebo group happened to be a little, but not significantly so, sicker than the verum group. The rather unremarkable fact that various measures of sickness (number, length and severity of sickness episodes etc.) were consistent with each other was mentioned by the De Lange et al. (1994). [6] This in its turn made the authors of chapter 10 mark this paper as showing a positive trend in favor of homeopathy. 
So altogether the whole of chapter 10 is another example of the standard technique nowadays used by homeopaths: they misrepresent papers on such a scale that only the most tenaceous critics have the energy to figure out all untruths.

","<p>It is rather strange to call this a Swiss government report. In the course of an evaluation of five alternative treatments which were being reimbursed by the Swiss public health insurance, several groups submitted reports. The Shang et al. paper (2005) was one of these reports. This book (published in German and in Germany in 2006) was another. The total result is that the Swiss government stopped the reimbursement. Only later a referendum made them reinstate it, and another round of evaluation will taken place in the future.</p>
<p>The present English book is an updated (mainly with criticism of Shang et al.) version of the 2006 book.<br />
You can read more about it in a critique by Edzard Ernst in the online FACT:<br />
<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2042-7166.2012.01160.x/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2042-7166.2012.01160.x/full</a></p>
<p>Ernst mostly looked at chapter 9, but I have been looking at chapter 10. Here is a summary of what I found. </p>
<p>Chapter 10 ‚Äì written by six authors, five of whom are homeopaths ‚Äì collects 29 studies in ‚ÄòUpper Respiratory Tract Infections/AllergicReactions‚Äô (URTI/A). This number is surprisingly small. I found 161 such studies by a cursory internet search. The authors managed to miss 25 studies that had been mentioned in earlier meta-analyses. Their investigation seem to have been a haste job, as they claimed lack of time for 5 studies. They included a study of what appears to be a single case of infectious mononucleosis (their number 12). They included one study (their number 4) but missed the one by the same principal author immediately preceding it in the same journal. They missed a Mexican paper (River√≥n-Garrote et al. 1998 [2]) that ‚Äòproved‚Äô homeopathy effective for asthma with p=0.00000000001 by my estimate. So the whole selection is haphazard and sloppy.</p>
<p>As small studies are unreliable and anything not a double blind RCT cannot be taken serious in homeopathy, I restricted my attention to the 11 placebo controlled double blind RCTs with more than 50 patients. </p>
<p>Two of these are large Oscillococcinum trials. These must be considered as dubious. The first one by Ferley et al. (1989) [3] selected of all patients with flu-like symptoms only the few that recovered in 48 hours, which happened to be the only possibility out of 14 yielding a statistically significant (correctly computed: p=0.0494) result. This can at best be considered an exploratory result of the weakest kind. A follow-up study was done (Papp et al. 1998, not in Pubmed [4]) in which the Ferley hypothesis was tested by a group led by Philippe Belon, research director of the manufacturer of Oscillococcinum. The null hypothesis could not be rejected (p=0.4). However, this result was not mentioned at all. Instead an undocumented test, the Krauth test, was said to yield p=0.0028. No details were given. </p>
<p>The other nine (in chronological order the numbers 8, 6, 10, 1, 4, 22, 24, 25, 29 in chapter 10) can all be found in Pubmed, and except number 6 (Reilly et al. 1986 [5]) they all returned a negative verdict: not significant, not effective, no clinical relevance, no evidence etc. The 30 per cent dropout rate in Reilly‚Äôs paper doesn‚Äôt inspire much confidence.

I think the homeopaths should wholeheartedly embrace this view
I am not clear about what s/he means. In medicine, I thought, the merits of any single treatment are judged by testing that treatment on a well defined group of subjects, usually with a single disease. In this sense there cannot be a test of ‚Äòhomeopathy‚Äô. One can test a single homeopathic claim such as
‚Äì ‚Äòblue eyed women who prefer lukewarm tea are cured of whatever ailment they have by Pulsatilla C30‚Äô or
‚Äì ‚Äòchildren with recurrent URTI will be a lot less sick, when treated by classical homeopathy in addition to usual care‚Äô or
‚Äì ‚Äòby means of an emanometer / dowsing rod / reproving it is possible to distinguish Belladonna 200C from Sulphur 200C‚Äô.
Of course, in the hypothetical case that many such tests favor homeopathy, one might be optimistic about the prospect of more positive tests. But even then each treatment of sick people should be separately tested. 
But in the real world the reviews show that there is no single combination of a homeopathic treatmen and a disease that has been shown to work consistently. 
In ordinary medicine meta-analysis and reviews refer to combinations of independent investigations of the same treatment-disease combination. Homeopathy reviews deviate from this because ‚Äòhomeopathy‚Äô is not a single treatment, but a ratbag of many different kinds. 
It also has been shown that when authors have some kind of stake (either their salary or a deeply held conviction) their research reports can be biased (at least in medicine). So reviews that politely conclude: ‚ÄòThe positive homeopathy results cannot be entirely due to the placebo effect‚Äô in fact say: ‚ÄòThe positive results in homeopathy are probably caused by extreme prejudice of the researchers, resulting in many different kinds of data massage, multiple comparisons, optional stops, selective treatment of dropouts, incompetent randomizing and faulty blinding, publication bias and maybe even outright fraud.‚Äô (Am I leaving out something?)
If one sees how seriously homeopaths are distorting what the published literature says, one cannot be very optimistic about what happens when they are left alone with the mass of data produced by their ‚Äòexperiment‚Äô and when they have to distill a paper from it for publication. 
There is one easy way to test homeopathy (not prove its effectivity), or rather one million easy ways. There are about one million claimed effects (1000 effects of 1000 remedies each) of highly diluted materials on healthy volunteers. These tests can be made without any cost. No sick people are put at risk. In fact, all over the world skeptic groups would be happy to cooperate and organise properly blinded and randomized tests. These claimed effects form the basis for any classical homeopathic prescription. 
So, homeopaths, do first a few of these tests! It won‚Äôt cost you a cent. But you have to provide a clear cut claim, not one that all the 100,000 other homeopaths will deny to have any relevance. Of course such tests have been done and they all have failed. Stronger: modern homeopaths absolutely refuse to cooperate with such tests. 
I conclude: as long as homeopaths refuse to do the simple tests, there is no reason to pay attention to all their claims. If they do the simple tests and fail, there is no reason to pay attention to them anymore. If they succeed they get Nobel prizes for physics, chemistry and medicine and peace, and science can move on to doing experiments with sick people.

<p>Kind of sucks for the few science-based chiropractors, saddled with a degree which doesn&#8217;t qualify them for a science-based profession.  But I don&#8217;t see a way around that.</p>

","<p>Well in Australia chiropractors know how to read and interpret blood work and biochemistry. I had a long-winded post about how I&#8217;ve been taught that &#8220;subluxation&#8221;, &#8220;vertebral subluxation complex&#8221; or &#8220;VSC&#8221; as it is termed is actually bunkem, but my wireless connection died and it lost the text.<br />

Klaus Linde, Wayne Jonas, Are the clinical effects of homoeopathy placebo effects?
Lancet. 2005 Dec 17;366(9503):2081-2
From this letter
We agree that homoeopathy is highly implausible and that the evidence from placebo-controlled trials is not robust. However, there are major problems with the way Shang and colleagues present and discuss their results, as well as how The Lancet reviewed and interpreted this study.
(‚Ä¶)
The Lancet should be embarrassed by the Editorial that accompanied the study. The conclusion that physicians should tell their patients that ‚Äúhomoeopathy has no benefit‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe time has passed for ‚Ä¶ further investment in research‚Äù is not backed at all by the data. Our 1997 meta-analysis has unfortunately been misused by homoeopaths as evidence that their therapy is proven. We now find it extremely disappointing that a major medical journal misuses a similar study in a totally uncritical and polemical manner. A subversive philosophy serves neither science nor patients.
Bold face by me. So even though Linde didn‚Äôt think much of the evidence from placebo-controlled trials in favor of homeopathy and also not much about Shang et al. he criticizes homeopaths for abusing his 1997 paper. 
The ‚Äòtop homeopathic publication‚Äô of Shang et al. was
Rottey EED, Verleye GB, Liagre RLP. Het effect van een homeopathische bereiding van microorganismen bij de preventie van griepsymptomen: een gerandomiseerd dubbel-blind onderzoek in de huisartspraktijk. Tijdschrift voor Integrale Geneeskunde 1995, vol. 11(1), p. 54-58.
I have read that Dutch article. There is only library in the whole of the Netherlands where one can find it. My conclusions were:
A double blind randomised trial for a homeopathically highly diluted preparation for the prevention of influenza was performed from September 1992 until April 1993. Altogether 501 subjects were analysed but an unknown number that may be as high as 499 were omitted from the study. No details are given about these dropouts. Although the verum group seemed to do better, the data are uninterpretable, for example it is unclear whether fever refers to fever days or fever periods and wehat exactly was meant by ‚Äòfever‚Äô. How many of the patients had influenza or even flulike symptoms or reported any kind of sickness is unknown. There seems to be no primary outcome that was defined before collection of data started. The authors report several significant outcomes, but no value can be attached to the paper as a whole.
I did some calculations on the sparse data of the paper. If we assume that patients with only 1 day during which they have symptoms do not have the flu at all, then I find:
placebo:
about 8 patients had together about 20 days fever
4 patients had together 9 days muscle pain
6 patients together had 12 days headache
verum:
6 patients had together 13 days fever
1 patient had 2 days muscle pain
2 patients had together 6 days headache
(not necesarily consecutive days, the patient groups mentioned here probably overlap)
So the number of patients with real flu in the 12 weeks that they were taking the pills was really very small. 
The point is that it is somewhat strange to rank this as a top quality homeopathy paper, just because the number (501) of patients involved is so high. A similar remark applies to Papp et al, which is clearly fraudulent.

<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but the idea that less intelligent, worstly trained students with zero applicable experience being taught by equally unskilled &#8220;practitioners&#8221; can interpret something that is completely outside of their realm is just laughable. Thankfully chiropractors can&#8217;t really do anything important after supposedly appreciating an abnormal lab value. </p>
<p>I&#8217; ask @nybgrus to comment. He&#8217;s arguably an extremely intelligent medical student, and I&#8217;d wager that he wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable interpreting the creatinine of a systolic heart failure patient and using his interpretation to adjust a Lasix dose. Not at this stage in his career. It&#8217;s something you learn with guidance and experience.</p>

When we stick to the classical form, it is a theory that doesn‚Äôt know any disease. The theory and ‚Äòdata‚Äô are as follows (bare essentials)
1. The cause of almost any sickness is utterly unknown.
2. However, each sick person has a disturbance of the life force, and this disturbance manifests itself through a large number of symptoms, such as fear of thunderstorms in general, itch on the right side of the nose, sudden aggravation after dinner, grating cough (note that the minutiae of ‚Äòcough‚Äô runs into the hundreds of descriptions).
3. Highly diluted materials (including north pole magnetism, table salt, chalk, sand, honeybees, snake venom, pus, and lots of poisonous plants) produce many symptoms when given to healthy people.
4. Giving a highly diluted material whose symptoms are most similar to the symptoms of the sick person, will be the cure.
5. This works roughly by the artifical sickness (of the remedy) driving out the real sickness (this can lead to the so-called initial aggravation), after which the artifical sickness will vanish.
In practice it is impossible to match the hundreds of ‚Äòsymptoms‚Äô (it takes an hour or so to determine these) of a sickness to the thousand or so symptoms of any ‚Äòremedy‚Äô. So the homeopath is trained to somehow pick out the most important or striking ones and match these to one (out a thousand) of the remedies that has these symptoms or similar ones in the long list associated with it.
So the homeopaths don‚Äôt claim that any particular remedy can cure any particular disease. They claim their whole method can treat any disease. And if it doesn‚Äôt work, one just has search for the better ‚Äòsimillimum‚Äô. 
The ‚Äòproof‚Äô that this is not all nonsense is:
A. the experience of Hahnemann after taking ground cinchona bark to test the way it cures ‚Äòfever‚Äô.
B. the many examples of so-called involuntary homeopathy in the past (*)
C. the fact that highly diluted stuff always produces symptoms
D. the experience of many homeopaths that their patients get better.
E. old stories about homeopathy being better than bloodletting in cholera wards. 
To describe the variants of homeopathy would take a whole book. Often homeopaths have just a few standard remedies which they match to general characteristics of their patients. Or they give Sulphur C30 for any kind of skin disease. Homeopaths who are physician will also try to establish a regular diagnosis. One kind of homeopath treats ‚Äòautism caused by vaccination‚Äô by giving highly diluted vaccins. Some manudfactures mix a couple of remedies together into an OTC preparation for specific indications. Oscillococcinum is supposed to prevent a specific disease.
* An example mentioned by Hahnemann and quoted by Wendell Holmes is the cobinateion of two anecdotes: a Byzantine princess revivinh her fainted brother the emperor using rose water, and the anecdote of a man fainting when exposed to a very strong rose smell. Cowpox vaccination against smallpox was considered another example.

Homeopathy serves no useful medical function in societies with strong traditions of it.
There. I just said it. I stand by it, too, ‚Äúentitled‚Äù or not.
While everyone has chosen to interpret .me otherwise, I was saying (as was obvious enough from context)  that our own science  does not permit such a sweeping statement.    Of course people can say it, if they choose to ignore certain matters. 
So let‚Äôs start afresh.   Are you, Weing, Dr Gosrki, and others dismissing placebo and other non-specific influences of medical interactions as being of no benefit to users, despite, if anything recent firming up of evidence in their favor?      
 Are you also unaware of the instinctive compulsions that drive much medical consumption, such that if you took homeopathy away it would be certainly be immediately replaced by potentially more dangerous CAM or folk methods?    There would also be increased pressure upon conventional medical services, with the risks and costs that derive from its tendency towards over-investigation and over-treatment,and  to produce adverse drug reactions.   
Do you not also see how the vast majority of the relevant therapeutic episodes (within and without the mainstream) relate to extremely common, minor, chronic or self-limiting complaints for many of which scientific medicine has little to offer or offers only partial relief?   If the alternative for the patient is basically to  put up with ongoing symptoms, why would we begrudge patients any small (and probably occasionally strong) relief that may be facilitated by these treatment rituals, especially if they help keep people out of doctor‚Äôs offices, with all the risks and costs therof?   
So I suggest that it can be scientifically , sociologically and medically  problematical, as well as possibly a tactical mistake to be solely focussed upon the usual  unqualified ‚Äúit works‚Äù /‚Äùno, it doesn‚Äôt‚Äù argument with homeopaths.   How are politicians or the public to decide between the opposing viewpoints especially when  some members of the public will also be pleading that it helps them?     
Why not acknowledge that homeopathy  is likely to be (almost inadvertently) helping some people through placebo and other non-specific influences,  but hammer home the point that dozens of other dubious medical treatments can do the same?     
The true problem is that no publicly funded health care system can afford to subsidize them all, or find any clear means of selecting some, but not all.    They are also optional add-ons to normal medical care,  making it unfair that  those who don‚Äôt want to use them should have to subsidize those who do.   
There has to be a cut-off point and consistent performance in quality placebo-controlled studies is the only realistic option.   If unable to perform so, let those who wish to practice or patronize these styles of medicine, do so at consumer expense, or with minimal public assistance and medical endorsement.
In support of this approach is the fact that as practiced in those countries with long experience of homeopathy working alongside the mainstream, it seems to be reasonably safe.  It seems that, given time, we can largely trust the public and most homeopaths to use it in a truly complementary role to mainstream medicine.
","<p>Dr Gorski:<i>We are not entitled to say that homeopathy serves no useful medical functions in these societies with strong traditions of it.<br />
Really?<br />
Homeopathy serves no useful medical function in societies with strong traditions of it.<br />
There. I just said it. I stand by it, too, ‚Äúentitled‚Äù or not.</i></p>
<p>While everyone has chosen to interpret .me otherwise, I was saying (as was obvious enough from context)  that <b>our own science</b>  does not permit such a sweeping statement.    Of course people can say it, if they choose to ignore certain matters. </p>
<p>So let&#8217;s start afresh.   Are you, Weing, Dr Gosrki, and others dismissing placebo and other non-specific influences of medical interactions as being of no benefit to users, despite, if anything recent firming up of evidence in their favor?      </p>
<p> Are you also unaware of the instinctive compulsions that drive much medical consumption, such that if you took homeopathy away it would be certainly be immediately replaced by potentially more dangerous <abbr title=""Complementary and Alternative Medicine"">CAM</abbr> or folk methods?

I shouldn‚Äôt have to repeat this, but we are not dismissing them as being of no benefit.

No, there is absolutely no truth to the claim that chiropractors have even remotely the same skill in diagnosis as MDs.
A chiropractor does not undergo any legitimate training whatsoever to allow them to diagnose the vast majority of medical conditions. Besides the obvious (on the average they are dumber students, they are poorly trained, and they have zero applicable clinical experience), they simply do not have any of the practical or educational basis to diagnose medical conditions beyond typical musculoskeletal ones. Any actual disease process and they are absolutely, without a doubt, 100% useless.
An MD is capable of utilizing and interpreting a vast array of results and patient history in order to confidently arrive at a diagnosis. These are tests that chiropractors are incapable of performing and interpreting. They simply aren‚Äôt exposed to it and have no education on them. As I wrote above, a chiropractor could look at a lab value and tell if it‚Äôs low or high, because the normal limit is listed right next to it, but they are absolutely incapable of interpreting the meaning of that value in context of any meaningful disease process.
Chiropractors can‚Äôt even distinguish between a real disease and a fake one, so how could we even entertain the idea that they could adequately distinguish between real diseases?

‚Äú4.‚Äù was a meta-analysis of the author‚Äôs own researches 1., 2., 3. Duh. The meta-analysis was favorable. All researches were of the type of individual classical homeopathic therapy as an adjunct to regular therapy, rehydratation. Then 5. was a large investigation. The five most popular remedies from 1., 2., 3. were combined in a tablet and given to more children then in 1. 2. 3. together. No individual counseling anymore. Incidentally completely against the teaching of Hahnemann who rather explictly forbade combining remedies. But then the research failed miserably.
How was that possible? I mean, what kind of corners were cut in the first three investigations? Comparing 1, 2 3 and 4 carefully, one sees the outcome measures changing, and in the meta-analysis gain other outcomes were used. 
1. is suspiciously small (34 patients in all) and non-significant. Suspicion: when they found out it didn‚Äôt work, they just stopped and called it a ‚Äòpilot‚Äô. It was published after the research for 2. was done.
2. barely significant and mentions 5 outcome measures. The numbers in the article are inconsistent.
3. announces that they plan to look at how long the diarrhea lasts, but this outcome measure is not reported; in 4. it is mentioned: non-significant. There are six years between the research and the publication. Paranoid types like me think that is the time they needed to rearrange the numbers until they looked ‚Äòpositive‚Äô.
4. among others, the numbers differ from those in 3., possibly because of the difference between ‚Äòstool‚Äô and ‚Äòunformed stool‚Äô. 
It seems that the authors have been constructing outcome measures after all data were in, and have been doing that in each investigation. Possibly they used the method of optional stop: looking at the results after every few patients: you stop as soon as you have ‚Äòreached significance‚Äô and also when failure threatens, but then you call it a pilot. 
Moral / remedy: don‚Äôt trust research unless (a) the research plan, including planned outcome measures and number of patients
has been published or registered prior to the investigation (b) blinding and randomizing are described in great detail (c) reassurance that no decision about what to calculate and what to put in the article was taken after breaking the code.

https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/on-the-ethics-of-clinical-trials-of-homeopathy-in-third-world-countries/

But the tricks to massage data into shape are probably not confined to homeopaths. But what better way to bring out those tricks than homeopathy research? In fact, it is almost certain that these papers contain tricks, the puzzle is just to locate them. In that way you learn lessons that can help you to spot errors in ordinary papers.

Any small random difference between verum and placebo can be blown up that way, and if you take the liberty to choose the disease symptoms too (of course after breaking the code), then you have an almost certain way to get the verum look better.

‚ÄúStrictly speaking any trial (or drug proving) that fails, is a failure of the whole of homeopathy, precisely because of the grandiose claims of homeopathy. Except it won‚Äôt convince any homeopath.‚Äù
It won‚Äôt convince me either. It‚Äôs a fundamentally illogical argument. And those grandiose claims are only grandiose in the light of the evidence which does rule out homeopathy and makes any CT‚Äôs results irrelevant anyway! As Badly Shaved Monkey pointed out elsewhere:

<p>‚ÄúStrictly speaking any trial (or drug proving) that fails, is a failure of the whole of homeopathy, precisely because of the grandiose claims of homeopathy. Except it won‚Äôt convince any homeopath.‚Äù</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t convince me either. It&#8217;s a fundamentally illogical argument. And those grandiose claims are only grandiose in the light of the evidence which does rule out homeopathy and makes any CT&#8217;s results irrelevant anyway! As Badly Shaved Monkey pointed out elsewhere:</p>

Most placebo effects are caused by people just getting better. No treatment at all would allow those.  A very small effect is caused by the treatment excluding any active material. To obtain this effect, one has to lie to the patient. While many years ago Doctors regularly prescribed placebos, now such a practice is usually frowned on.
Allowing patients to fund their own excursions into anti-medicine is not a great idea unless their freedom of choice is accompanied by freedom of information. Homeopaths certainly cannot be trusted in this area. The Swiss report is just the latest piece of misinformation to come from them. Above is a comment from Mojo showing the misinformation from the BHS.
But in general, homeopaths are anti-medicine. They recommend against medicine in very dangerous areas such as malaria prophylaxis, AIDS and cholera.
If people considering homeopathy want to help sick people, why don‚Äôt they become Doctors or nurses? If they go into homeopathy because they feel it to be more lucrative or easier or from a bias against EBM then educating people to avoid them will be a public service.

This is a thoroughly entrenched skeptical ‚Äútrope‚Äù.

re: Prescription/pharmacology:

I strongly disagree that the reason for ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù what medications do is related to chiropractic in any way other than to give DCs some (imaginary) ammunition to warn their customers of the dangers of any and all medications. Once again I draw on 30+ years of investigating chiropractic to reach the conclusion that the majority of them never pass up a chance to warn against the putative dangers of medication ‚Äì prescription or OTC. And this includes immunization as well. Among the major differences chiropractors like to cite that keep them separate and distinct from science-based healthcare is their subluxation chimera and the ‚Äúdrug-free‚Äù approach to healthcare. 
Certainly drugs can harm. But they can also be of amazing benefit. The basic idea is for a well trained healthcare professional to monitor the drugs he/she prescribes to ensure that the benefit-to-risk ratio is taken into consideration. On the other hand there are no known benefits to subluxation adjustments because there‚Äôs no such thing as a (chiropractic) subluxation.

If PT&#8217;s want to have the same scope of practice as DC&#8217;s all they have to do is add the DDx education that DC&#8217;s have that matches MD&#8217;s. Then they can be MD&#8217;s who speacilize in physical medicine. Oh wait, there already is one Physiatrist (sp?)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now my question is, is there any truth to the claim that chiropractors have the same education in differential diagnosis as MDs?</p>

Regarding the physiology of C02 and hypocapnia: at least one of the ways thyroid (T3) stimulates metabolism is facilitating the conversion of pyruvate to Acetyl CoA, increasing C02 from the TCA cycle. If you kill a mouse with too much cytomel (I don‚Äôt admit to doing this) you‚Äôll find the mouse is extremely emaciated, but also its bones are much stronger than a *normal* sacrificed mouse. Thyroid promotes the creation of C02, C02 strengthens the bones, probably by binding to lysine residues and forming a carbamino anion which will bind to calcium. By regulating bone calcium in this manner the gas (and sugar metabolism) can effect PTH and calcitonin‚Ä¶if‚Äôs that right now we are talking about C02 as part of a huge crosstalk system with some of the big hormonal players. The change in C02 from hyperventilation is not insignificant or ‚Äúmild‚Äù‚Ä¶easy to measure with a metabolic cage or painstakingly with boring calculations from the known products of metabolism‚Ä¶we can store 100‚Äôs of liters in our bones.
Moreover, we find in many diseases extremely high ratios of NADH to NAD+‚Ä¶the mitochondria are *shut down* and the electron carriers are trying to dump their e‚Äôs to pyruvate to make lactate. C02 production is lower without the TCA cycle and cytoplasm is overreduced (this is shown for instance with the presence of large #‚Äôs of SH groups). C02 itself will resist some of these problems‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a strong lewis acid so it can pull electrons out of the system, it‚Äôs presence on te RBC‚Äôs causes oxygen content to be increased in the tissues, etc‚Ä¶ some oldschool physiologists like Koch suggested its role may be in some situations like the quinones, but C02 is a self generating compound of this sort. I could go on and on but FWIW I don‚Äôt think C02 reduction in hypoventilation is mild or it is beyond our understanding of physiology to think hyperventilation would effect metabolism as well as be effected.

Dr. Crislip, 
I am curious as to why you state this. Pulse oximetry is an enormously useful vital sign particularly in the ICU and in the OR, where I spend the majority of my time. Another particularly useful vital sign/measurement is capnography. The practice of anesthesia was altered by these two measurements. The most important would be confirming tracheal intubation. Pulse oximetry is useful to indicate hypoxia, hints at hypovolemia with pulse wave variation, and can even be utilized as a monitor of ventilation if a patient is on room air (very rapid desaturations if a patient is apneic or hypo ventilating). The ability to correct O2 sats with PEEP indicates atelectasis and one can help to differentiate between dead space and shunt. 
Capnography, though never vying for the ‚Äúfifth vital sign‚Äù is probably my favorite monitor indicating hypo/hyperventilation, cardiac output and adequacy of resuscitation, rebreathing, obstruction, embolus, etc. Both of these monitors are invaluable in ICU/Anesthesiology.

The ethical considerations only apply to mainstream doctors who choose to use a treatment method knowing it is a placebo.   It does not apply to homeopaths who believe in it or to patients who may have come to rely upon homeopathic remedies for some conditions.

Here is an extract from the main meta-analysis of placebo versus no treatment studies ‚Äî
Quote ‚Äî 
 Outcome data were available in 202 out of 234 included trials, investigating 60 clinical conditions. We regarded the risk of bias as low in only 16 trials (8%), five of which had binary outcomes.
In 44 studies with binary outcomes (6041 patients), there was moderate heterogeneity (P < 0.001; I2 45%) but no clear difference in effects between small and large trials (symmetrical funnel plot). The overall pooled effect of placebo was a relative risk of 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.99). The pooled relative risk for patient-reported outcomes was 0.93 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.00) and for observer-reported outcomes 0.93 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.02). We found no statistically significant effect of placebo interventions in four clinical conditions that had been investigated in three trials or more: pain, nausea, smoking, and depression, but confidence intervals were wide. The effect on pain varied considerably, even among trials with low risk of bias.
In 158 trials with continuous outcomes (10,525 patients), there was moderate heterogeneity (P < 0.001; I2 42%), and considerable variation in effects between small and large trials (asymmetrical funnel plot). It is therefore a questionable procedure to pool all the trials, and we did so mainly as a basis for exploring causes for heterogeneity. We found an overall effect of placebo treatments, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.23 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.17). The SMD for patient-reported outcomes was -0.26 (95% CI -0.32 to -0.19), and for observer-reported outcomes, SMD -0.13 (95% CI -0.24 to -0.02). We found an effect on pain, SMD -0.28 (95% CI -0.36 to -0.19)); nausea, SMD -0.25 (-0.46 to -0.04)), asthma (-0.35 (-0.70 to -0.01)), and phobia (SMD -0.63 (95% CI -1.17 to -0.08)). The effect on pain was very variable, also among trials with low risk of bias. Four similarly-designed acupuncture trials conducted by an overlapping group of authors reported large effects (SMD -0.68 (-0.85 to -0.50)) whereas three other pain trials reported low or no effect (SMD -0.13 (-0.28 to 0.03)). The pooled effect on nausea was small, but consistent. The effects on phobia and asthma were very uncertain due to high risk of bias. There was no statistically significant effect of placebo interventions in the seven other clinical conditions investigated in three trials or more: smoking, dementia, depression, obesity, hypertension, insomnia and anxiety, but confidence intervals were wide.
Meta-regression analyses showed that larger effects of placebo interventions were associated with physical placebo interventions (e.g. sham acupuncture), patient-involved outcomes (patient-reported outcomes and observer-reported outcomes involving patient cooperation), small trials, and trials with the explicit purpose of studying placebo. Larger effects of placebo were also found in trials that did not inform patients about the possible placebo intervention.
Authors' conclusions
We did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical effects in general. However, in certain settings placebo interventions can influence patient-reported outcomes, especially pain and nausea, though it is difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of placebo from biased reporting. The effect on pain varied, even among trials with low risk of bias, from negligible to clinically important. Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed.

The pooled relative risk for patient-reported outcomes was 0.93 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.00) and for observer-reported outcomes 0.93 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.02). We found no statistically significant effect of placebo interventions in four clinical conditions that had been investigated in three trials or more: pain, nausea, smoking, and depression, but confidence intervals were wide. The effect on pain varied considerably, even among trials with low risk of bias.<br />
In 158 trials with continuous outcomes (10,525 patients), there was moderate heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.001; I2 42%), and considerable variation in effects between small and large trials (asymmetrical funnel plot). It is therefore a questionable procedure to pool all the trials, and we did so mainly as a basis for exploring causes for heterogeneity. We found an overall effect of placebo treatments, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.23 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.17). The SMD for patient-reported outcomes was -0.26 (95% CI -0.32 to -0.19), and for observer-reported outcomes, SMD -0.13 (95% CI -0.24 to -0.02). We found an effect on pain, SMD -0.28 (95% CI -0.36 to -0.19)); nausea, SMD -0.25 (-0.46 to -0.04)), asthma (-0.35 (-0.70 to -0.01)), and phobia (SMD -0.63 (95% CI -1.17 to -0.08)). The effect on pain was very variable, also among trials with low risk of bias. Four similarly-designed acupuncture trials conducted by an overlapping group of authors reported large effects (SMD -0.68 (-0.85 to -0.50)) whereas three other pain trials reported low or no effect (SMD -0.13 (-0.28 to 0.03)). The pooled effect on nausea was small, but consistent. The effects on phobia and asthma were very uncertain due to high risk of bias. There was no statistically significant effect of placebo interventions in the seven other clinical conditions investigated in three trials or more: smoking, dementia, depression, obesity, hypertension, insomnia and anxiety, but confidence intervals were wide.<br />
Meta-regression analyses showed that larger effects of placebo interventions were associated with physical placebo interventions (e.g. sham acupuncture), patient-involved outcomes (patient-reported outcomes and observer-reported outcomes involving patient cooperation), small trials, and trials with the explicit purpose of studying placebo. Larger effects of placebo were also found in trials that did not inform patients about the possible placebo intervention.<br />
Authors&#039; conclusions<br />
We did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical effects in general. However, in certain settings placebo interventions can influence patient-reported outcomes, especially pain and nausea, though it is difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of placebo from biased reporting. The effect on pain varied, even among trials with low risk of bias, from negligible to clinically important. Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed.</p>

@BJ, to address your statements and questions:
In undiagnosed pain you wouldn‚Äôt want to, would you? You might miss a ruptured aneurysm. Or you might miss a drug addict! However, once you‚Äôd diagnosed kidney stones ‚Äì which, I guess shoudn‚Äôt be too hard even for a mediocre doc ‚Äì then, yeah, pile on the pain meds.
üôÇ Again dictating how doctors should practice!!!
That doesn‚Äôt really make sense. I don‚Äôt think any doc would treat ‚Äúundiagnosed pain‚Äù?
Doc: ‚ÄúHello, BJ, how can I help you today?‚Äù
BJ: ‚ÄúI have pain.‚Äù
Doc: ‚ÄúOk, dont‚Äô tell me anything else, here are pain meds!‚Äù
This is why we take a history and perform a physical exam and lab tests. I would ask you where the pain is, and you would point to your kidneys, and then I‚Äôd ask if it spreads anywhere in your body, and you might point towards your groin. You might also tell me about problems going to the bathroom, or that you‚Äôve had this pain before, and I might run some simple tests on you, such as a urinalysis. 
If you had a ruptured abdominal aneurysm, then you‚Äôd have excruciating abdominal pain, you‚Äôd have a gigantic pulsating mass in your belly, and you‚Äôd probably have a feeling that your world is moments away from coming to an end. I‚Äôd sincerely hope you wouldn‚Äôt be in an office complaining about this, and that you‚Äôd be at an emergency room!
(Hmmm‚Ä¶I wonder how good drug addicts are at faking the pain of kidney stones?)
It can actually be very difficult or very easy to identify drug seeking behavior. When they come in for the first time and start telling you how another doctor was giving them Soma and Lortab, but then something crazy happened, yeah, get out. Or the patient has some provable cause of pain, and you say ‚ÄúOk, we can try Xxx‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not what the patient wants (Lortab) so they say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm allergic to that.‚Äù You reply ‚ÄúOk, how about Naproxen?‚Äù and they are ‚Äúallergic‚Äù to that too! They magically are allergic to every medication except for the one they want. You ask them what happens when they take it, knowing full well that they are not allergic, and they say ‚ÄúOh my stomach hurts‚Äù, or if they‚Äôve read a little they say ‚ÄúI swell up.‚Äù That can be difficult ‚Äì you know the patient is in pain, and the medication they want would be effective, but you also know that they are lying about being allergic to the medication that you think is most appropriate. 
For some people, the ‚Äúculture‚Äù of the way they were raised influences their belief about pain medications. Perhaps they were of lower socioeconomic status and were raised with parents who were either legitimately or illegitimately on chronic pain medication. Now this person breaks their foot, and insists that they get Lortab for the pain. You, as the doctor, have experienced the exact same break in your foot and know that it does not hurt that bad, and that you got by without even taking an Advil for it. You tell the patient that such medication is not appropriate treatment for their injury, and now they become furious. They may leave your office, but now they are going to focus on the pain in their foot so much that it will ‚Äúhurt‚Äù them more and more, and they will become fixated on finding a doctor who ‚Äúisn‚Äôt an idiot‚Äù and will give them what they ‚Äúknow they need.‚Äù Another example for PCPs are patients who want narcotics for their diabetic neuropathy. It‚Äôs completely inappropriate, ineffective, etc, but they ‚Äúknow‚Äù it works.
I‚Äôve been cussed out and told what an idiot I am many times because I rightly don‚Äôt give out opiods for inappropriate reasons.

A major pathway in acute infection response is expression of iNOS and generation of very high NO levels.  The main function of this very high NO level is to suppress bacterial quorum sensing, suppress expression of bacterial virulence factors and most importantly to suppress formation of a bacterial biofilm on the inside of the vasculature.  As bad as bacteria floating in the blood stream is, if they attach as a biofilm somewhere it is at least 100 times worse.  That is why sepsis is such an extreme state.  Physiology is trying desperately to prevent the bacteria from forming a biofilm and is willing to risk death to do so because if a biofilm does form, then you essentially are dead (in the absence of ID docs like Dr Crislip with antibiotics to kill bugs).  
This very high NO level has the effect of shutting down ATP production via mitochondria in most tissue compartments.  There are two main pathways, the high NO level regulates the ATP level to be high (via their combined effect on sGC) and also by blocking cytochrome c oxidase.  The high ATP level turns off mitochondria because they are not needed to supply ATP.  Instead the ATP is supplied by glycolysis.  Unfortunately, glycolysis supplies about 5% of the amount of ATP per glucose molecule that mitochondria do.  To maintain the same ATP production rate the vasculature would need to deliver ~20 times more glucose than it normally does.  It can‚Äôt do this without hyperglycemia (which is why there is hyperglycemia during an infection) and even hyperglycemia isn‚Äôt enough.  The liver doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to produce 20x more glucose, so the muscles turn themselves into amino acids and those amino acids get turned into glucose.  Cells use that glucose to make ATP and lactate and then the lactate has to be disposed of by being turned into fat.  This is why during sepsis people can lose 40 pounds of muscle and gain 10 pounds of fat in just a couple of days.  
If physiology can‚Äôt supply enough glucose to keep the ATP level high enough to keep the mitochondria off, the when the ATP level falls, the mitochondria do turn on, and in the high NO environment of sepsis the mitochondria are irreversibly turned off.  This is the mechanism for multiple organ failure in sepsis.

re: that web site. People that suffer from chronic pain lead a challenging life. The bad thing is that usually people suffer from something that isn‚Äôt their own fault. They need to also understand that while we have some very strong pharmaceuticals available, we have to be responsible with them. If a pain doc insists that you take the medication as he prescribed, and he urine tests you and you skipped a dose, or doubled up, or whatever, then the patient has to understand that they aren‚Äôt following the doctor‚Äôs directions and that they can (and will) be ‚Äúfired‚Äù so-to-speak.

Harriet: .‚Äúdismissing placebo and other non-specific influences of medical interactions as being of no benefit to users,‚Äù
 I shouldn‚Äôt have to repeat this, but we are not dismissing them as being of no benefit.
What have Weing and Dr Gorski just said?
The important detail is that placebo benefits are not unique to things like homeopathy.  Therefore, one can dismiss placebo effects as support for homeopathy without dismissing the benefits of placebo effects.  What if the homeopath‚Äôs office is located next to a grocery store?  Are we being narrow-minded if we say that homeopathy does not deserve credit for it?
There is no way of obtaining a truly ‚Äúnot handled at all medically‚Äù group.
1.  That is only a problem if you are determined to say that homeopathy deserves credit for its placebo effects while calling those same effects confounding factors for real interventions.  It is interesting to study placebo effects, but that is not necessary to rule out the validity of a medical claim.
2. Your claim that a no-intervention group for the purposes of placebo studies is not possible is probably not true functionally.  A mixture of groups being told yes/no/maybe for both the placebo and the test substance can give you plenty of functional data (I don‚Äôt think I invented that, in fact I am pretty sure I first heard about it in a study presented here).  And what is your point anyway?  You are arguing against the possibility of evidence for your own position.

This is something <i>I</i> hear a lot; people prefer to deny the possibility of a difference to avoid the sometimes unpleasant work of figuring things out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, banning &#8220;homeopathy&#8221;, or simply refusing to pay for it, is not actually a ban on your personal behavior.  You can still buy drops of water and sugar pills and swallow them.  People just aren&#8217;t allowed to sell them to you on the claim that those things will cure cancer, nor should the government (under a socialist medical system) accept billing for water drops on the grounds that fake pills are a medical necessity.</p>

Agreed, if you are referring to homeopathy as ‚Äúthat set of principles under which homeopathy  is practiced‚Äù but the discussion up until this point clearly related to whether the  use of homeopathic remedies or practitioners can serve ‚Äúuseful medical functions‚Äù.

1. That is only a problem if you are determined to say that homeopathy deserves credit for its placebo effects while calling those same effects confounding factors for real interventions. It is interesting to study placebo effects, but that is not necessary to rule out the validity of a medical claim.
2. Your claim that a no-intervention group for the purposes of placebo studies is not possible is probably not true functionally. A mixture of groups being told yes/no/maybe for both the placebo and the test substance can give you plenty of functional data (I don‚Äôt think I invented that, in fact I am pretty sure I first heard about it in a study presented here). And what is your point anyway? You are arguing against the possibility of evidence for your own position.

I was talking generally about the complexities of clinical studies of placebo responses and indicating that they can indeed ‚Äúconfound‚Äù in opposite directions.    
There is no doubt that if you go out of your way to induce placebo responses  you will always get them.  The only uncertainty is how much fo those apparent responses are due to reporting biases.    In relation to that, modern neurphysiological studies suggest that are at least in part ‚Äúreal‚Äù physiological repsonses.   Other studies have shown a morphine-sparing effect of palcebo in severe pain.  Never forget that placebo theory got its main boost from the observation that saline injections could often relieve severe post-opertive pain. 
Yet ‚Äîwhile  I have my own impression of what is likely to be the truth, I acknowledge that we have no final  answer, and our considerations should reflect that.

So would I.  In fact my original comment included 2 paragraphs exploring that theme but I ultimately decided that it was slightly off-topic so I deleted them.
Mark Crislip has addressed over- and mis- use of antibiotics and Harriett Hall has explored some entrenched unscientific positions taken by some physicians.  Drs. Gorski and Novella have drawn a few sharp comparisons between EBM and SBM.  But in general SBM seems far more concerned with the antics of the lunatic fringe than with practicing physicians.
For instance I did a search of SBM a while back looking for references to Dartmouth‚Äôs Atlas Project but didn‚Äôt find anything.  Their work would seem to provide foundation for some really interesting blogs.  I would also be interested in seeing some critical analyses of some of the ‚Äòbest practices‚Äô work being done.
There are limits to the fraction of GDP that a country can spend on healthcare.  Some would argue that the US is at ‚Äì or beyond ‚Äì that limit now.  Overdiagnosis, overtreatment and ineffective treatment very likely consume a higher fraction of health care expenditures than all the hand-waiving, needle-tweedling and subluxation-chasing combined.

I have written about overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and ineffective treatments.

Many thanks for writing a review of Dr. Nesse and the late George C. Williams‚Äô book Why We Get Sick on such a short notice. I am a passionate evolutionist and Darwinian to the core and one of the basic claims of evolutionary biologists (e.g. professor Dawkins, professor Ewald, etc.) is that medical doctors are still lagging behind in Darwinian thought despite The Origin of Species being published in 1859. Because I am a Darwinian, I naturally followed people that I admired and believed professor Dawkins, professor Shubin, Dr. Nesse, and others regarding the fundamental soundness of Darwinian medicine. I also firmly believed professor Ewald‚Äôs contention that the medical establishment is somewhat reactionary to evolutionary medicine and that the older camp may have to be expunged though time before fresh Darwinian insights could unravel. For instance:
‚Äú‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs one of the realities of medicine ‚Äì researchers tend to deny associations. Denial plays a major role as scientists love to hold on to the current dogmatic explanation. This suggests that in order for pathogens to be fully tied to chronic disease we will have to wait until the current powerful people pass away and a sufficient number of young people entering the arena without these vested interests mature into positions of influence, to tip the balance of expert opinion. This is something that Charles Darwin, Max Planck, and Thomas Kuhn all agreed with‚Ä¶‚Äù

http://bacteriality.com/2008/02/11/ewald/
However, now I admire a separate‚Äîbut closely related camp‚Äîof medical doctors representing science-based medicine. I was a little bit concerned that the ideas of evolutionary medicine may clash with the thoughts of the camp at sciencebasedmedicine.org, but it appears that Dr. Gorski and Dr. Novella are Darwin-friendly and warmly welcome evolutionary insights into medicine (1-3). It appears that Dr. Gorski is a staunch evolutionist too (and has managed to annoy the lovely crowd over at uncommondescent). LOL. (4)
Despite my deep-seated convictions, the scholarship of Dr. Hall has forced me to seriously reconsider my views on Darwinian medicine and perhaps entertain the thought that the lack of attention the medical establishment has given to Darwinian medicine may be a reflection of the fruitlessness of its organizing principles, rather than reactionary sentiment. I do not know yet, that is why I am going to print this review off and read it thoroughly.
Also, thank you Dr. Gorski for your insights.

My two cents? That evolutionary principles in medicine should be taught like and treated similarly to embryology in medicine. 
How many times do we applythe principles of embryology in regular clinical practice? Why do medical students hate embryology so much? (basically never, and because they see it as being irrelavent to clinical practice). These days med students get all riled up when they think that what they are learning wont be directly relevant to their clinical practice. Heck, I just commented on a post on reddit about a guy asking how to best get through his clinical rotations. His take? There was no need for critical thinking since that was too time consuming and if he just hammered in algorithms and guidelines that would be much better. I told him go right ahead if he wanted to be a mediocre doctor who was nothing more than a glorified mechanic who will struggle keeping up to date.
But I digress. The point I am trying to make is that just like embryology, evolutionary biology is a very handy organizing principle for learning things relevant to clinical practice. I remember my anatomy and congential defects much, much better than many of my colleagues because I actually studied embryo in my first two years and they didn‚Äôt. I can keep molecular receptors and their varying affinities and actions straight better than my colleagues because when I learned them I did so from an evolutionary perspective. Learning the evolution of the gluccocorticoid receptor from the mineralocorticoid receptor was interesting (to me at least) and also helped me to understand and remember affinities and properties of the physiological responses to activation. Same with Œ≤HCG and TSH. You can go on and on.
So from my perspective I can clearly see what Dr. Hall is saying ‚Äì yeah, evolutionary principles really don‚Äôt actually make a difference in clinical practice. But from that perspective (and you know I respect you greatly, Dr. Hall) this post may as well have gone:
‚ÄúDo we need ‚ÄòEvolutionary Medicine‚Äô?‚Äù
‚ÄúMicheal Egnor.‚Äù
‚ÄúQED.‚Äù
But then we have to ask ourselves what do we actually want our physicians to be like? Glorified mechanics who do things without really understanding why? Or actual critical thinkers that can generate hypotheses and better react to the ever changing landscape of their patient population and novel therapeutic modalities? I would argue that the vast majority of medicine can be done without understanding the underlying principles and in fact mid-level practitioners fill in that volume gap quite nicely. The reason we still need physicians is to be able to recognize and deal with the exceptions. Disconnecting ourselves from the basic process that leads us to the understanding and knowledge that we do have limits our ability to do so (and I‚Äôll add makes studies on CAM look more appealing). By further enhancing that basic understanding of the process and not just the outcomes, I would argue that phsyicians will be more capable to accurately and adequately treat even more people. There is a cost-benefit analysis to be done there, and we all recognize there are diminishing returns on eeking out those last few percentage points, but the principle stands. 
A Jiffy Lube mechanic does not need to understand the principles of mechanical and materials engineering to do his job extremely well. Do we want physicians to be Jiffy Lube mechanics for people? What do we want to define the job of a physician as (vs a nurse practitioner or physician‚Äôs assistant)? I think that is the ultimate question here.

I told him go right ahead if he wanted to be a mediocre doctor who was nothing more than a glorified mechanic who will struggle keeping up to date.</p>
<p>But I digress. The point I am trying to make is that just like embryology, evolutionary biology is a very handy organizing principle for learning things relevant to clinical practice. I remember my anatomy and congential defects much, much better than many of my colleagues because I actually studied embryo in my first two years and they didn&#8217;t. I can keep molecular receptors and their varying affinities and actions straight better than my colleagues because when I learned them I did so from an evolutionary perspective. Learning the evolution of the gluccocorticoid receptor from the mineralocorticoid receptor was interesting (to me at least) and also helped me to understand and remember affinities and properties of the physiological responses to activation. Same with Œ≤HCG and TSH. You can go on and on.</p>
<p>So from my perspective I can clearly see what Dr. Hall is saying &#8211; yeah, evolutionary principles really don&#8217;t actually make a difference in clinical practice. But from that perspective (and you know I respect you greatly, Dr. Hall) this post may as well have gone:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we need &#8216;Evolutionary Medicine&#8217;?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Micheal Egnor.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;QED.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then we have to ask ourselves what do we actually want our physicians to be like? Glorified mechanics who do things without really understanding why? Or actual critical thinkers that can generate hypotheses and better react to the ever changing landscape of their patient population and novel therapeutic modalities? I would argue that the vast majority of medicine can be done without understanding the underlying principles and in fact mid-level practitioners fill in that volume gap quite nicely. The reason we still need physicians is to be able to recognize and deal with the exceptions. Disconnecting ourselves from the basic process that leads us to the understanding and knowledge that we do have limits our ability to do so (and I&#8217;ll add makes studies on <abbr title=""Complementary and Alternative Medicine"">CAM</abbr> look more appealing). By further enhancing that basic understanding of the <i>process</i> and not just the outcomes, I would argue that phsyicians will be more capable to accurately and adequately treat even more people. There is a cost-benefit analysis to be done there, and we all recognize there are diminishing returns on eeking out those last few percentage points, but the principle stands. </p>
<p>A Jiffy Lube mechanic does not need to understand the principles of mechanical and materials engineering to do his job extremely well. Do we want physicians to be Jiffy Lube mechanics for people? What do we want to define the job of a physician as (vs a nurse practitioner or physician&#8217;s assistant)? I think that is the ultimate question here.</p>

Keep in mind your statement about the poor also applies to you.

In Canada a universal public health care option also requires a universal government ID card, which cuts down on the number of noncitizens able to take advantage of services not paid into through taxes.

Well, no kidding? Who maintains the contrary? Certainly not professor Ewald. Verbatim:
‚ÄúCancer is really a special case of the problems we have discussed. The same dogma has been driving how the disease is viewed for so long. But if people are able to recognize the dogma for what it is, they can take a better look at definitive evidence about the disease. Taking a look at the track record of cancer researchers is a good way to decide whether the consensus view is right or wrong.
Back in 1975, mainstream medicine agreed that about 0.1% of human cancer cases were caused by pathogens. When it came to the rest of cases, their view was that they were probably caused by a combination of inherited predispositions and mutagens. Then in 1985, the percentage of cancer cases they tied to pathogens was 3%, and they continued to make the same argument about the remaining cases. In 1995 the percent of pathogen-induced cancer cases was accepted to be around 10%. Now, we‚Äôre at 20%. Still, mainstream medicine contends that the other 80% of cases do not have an infectious cause, but the questions is ‚Äì do you believe them anymore? In this sense, the clarity of hindsight can help a lot. Between evolutionary instinct and plain common sense we can view the issues of pathogens and cancer much more effectively.‚Äù

But it can be so cool. I happened to come across something I wrote over at Medscape a couple of years ago, so allow me a quick cut and paste re: evolution of fever:
Insects can be infected with 50,000 different fungi and plants are susceptible to 270,000 fungi.  Humans? Many fewer, maybe a couple of dozen pathogenic fungi at best and few that infect normal people.  And it may be due to the fact that we are warmer than ambient temperature.
In a recent JID article they tested the growth characteristics  of 4800 fungi at a variety of temperatures from 4 to 45 degrees C, and as the temperature went up, the number of fungi that could grow declined.  They found for each increase in temperature of 1 degree C, they ‚Äúexcluded an additional 6% of fungal isolates, implying that fever could significantly increase the thermal exclusion zone.‚Äù
Perhaps not being consumed by fungi helped drive the evolution of increased body temperature.
‚ÄúEndothermy is associated with certain metabolic benefits and thermodynamic efficiency, but these benefits come at a high cost since endothermic vertebrates require <10 times more oxygen to support metabolism than do ectothermic vertebrates [8] . Our analysis suggests that part of the cost is mitigated by the creation of a thermal exclusionary zone that can protect against environmental microbes. Given the high metabolic cost of endothermy, the core temperatures of individual mammal and bird species are likely to be a compromise between its benefits and costs. If endothermy was selected for protection against infectious disease, then a case could be made that endothermy preceded homeothermy. Similarly, if one considers fever as a mechanism to extend the thermal exclusionary zone against environmental microbes such as fungi, increases in temperature of only 1-3 degree C can significantly reduce the proportion of such microbes that can inhabit the host.""
Even cooler is they have found a burst in fungal fossils at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary when the dinosaurs died off.
A meteor hits earth, increasing the amount of organic material for fungi to feed on, the fungi proliferate to kill off the surviving dinosaurs, and we mammals remain, resistant to the fungi. It pays to be warm.
It wasn't the cigarettes after all.

Of course in my view there is nothing about religious belief or any ideology that has any redeeming quality whatsoever.

"344252","163","133836",,"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/21546/",,"Patrick, I looked at the interview you linked to, and there is a gigantic blind spot in Ewald‚Äôs reasoning.  He lists 3 possible causes of disease:
1.  Inherited genes
2.  Parasitic agents (this includes bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa    
3.  Non-living environmental factors (too much or too little of a particular substance, radiation, exposure to a chemical etc.)
These are all well and good, but he left out a fourth mechanism.
4.  Loss of beneficial commensal organisms.  
It is #4 that is the major cause of modern diseases, specifically the loss of the commensal ammonia oxidizing bacteria which live on the external skin and metabolize the ammonia in sweat into NO and nitrite.  This sets the basal level of NO species, and is a major global control setpoint that regulates essentially all major subsystems.  
http://books.google.com/books?id=a3mwmXzpsjkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q&f=false
In terms of chronic inflammation, NO inhibits NFkB and is the normal pathway to reduce inflammation.  Low NO potentiates mast cell degranulation, the respiratory burst lowers NO levels and provides for a robust turn-on of the immune system when it is triggered.  
The anecdotes about low dose antibiotics seeming to ‚Äúwork‚Äù is artifact.  It is the killing of non-resistant bacteria in the gut, those bacteria spill antigens, those antigens produce a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which causes expression of iNOS and transiently increases NO levels which causes transient symptomatic relief of the symptoms that are caused by low NO due to the loss of commensal ammonia oxidizing bacteria.   
I think that the preoccupation of ID docs with killing bugs (sorry Dr Crislip üòâ ) is misplaced.  Being killed provides a strong evolutionary pressure to evolve resistance to whatever is doing the killing.  Since there always has to be a transition between where the antibacterial agent has a high enough concentration to kill and where it doesn‚Äôt, there will always be bacteria exposed to sub-lethal levels.  I outline what I think is a better approach here.
http://daedalus2u.blogspot.com/2008/06/suggestion-to-reduce-antibiotic.html
Suppressing virulence is just as effective at preventing disease as is killing the infectious agent.  If it is not expressing virulence, then it is not virulent.  Much of what prevents infection is a microbiome of non-pathogenic organisms that suppress pathogens.

The advantage of suppressing virulence is that organisms don‚Äôt evolve resistance to it.  Suppressing virulence is how most eukaryotes suppress biofilms on their surfaces.
","<p>Patrick, I looked at the interview you linked to, and there is a gigantic blind spot in Ewald&#8217;s reasoning.  He lists 3 possible causes of disease:</p>
<p>1.  Inherited genes</p>
<p>2.  Parasitic agents (this includes bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa    </p>
<p>3.  Non-living environmental factors (too much or too little of a particular substance, radiation, exposure to a chemical etc.)</p>
<p>These are all well and good, but he left out a fourth mechanism.</p>
<p>4.  Loss of beneficial commensal organisms.  </p>
<p>It is #4 that is the major cause of modern diseases, specifically the loss of the commensal ammonia oxidizing bacteria which live on the external skin and metabolize the ammonia in sweat into NO and nitrite.  This sets the basal level of NO species, and is a major global control setpoint that regulates essentially all major subsystems.  </p>
<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=a3mwmXzpsjkC&#038;lpg=PP1&#038;pg=PA103#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=a3mwmXzpsjkC&#038;lpg=PP1&#038;pg=PA103#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false</a></p>
<p>In terms of chronic inflammation, NO inhibits NFkB and is the normal pathway to reduce inflammation.  Low NO potentiates mast cell degranulation, the respiratory burst lowers NO levels and provides for a robust turn-on of the immune system when it is triggered.  </p>
<p>The anecdotes about low dose antibiotics seeming to ‚Äúwork‚Äù is artifact.  It is the killing of non-resistant bacteria in the gut, those bacteria spill antigens, those antigens produce a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which causes expression of iNOS and transiently increases NO levels which causes transient symptomatic relief of the symptoms that are caused by low NO due to the loss of commensal ammonia oxidizing bacteria.   </p>
<p>I think that the preoccupation of ID docs with killing bugs (sorry Dr Crislip üòâ ) is misplaced.  Being killed provides a strong evolutionary pressure to evolve resistance to whatever is doing the killing.  Since there always has to be a transition between where the antibacterial agent has a high enough concentration to kill and where it doesn&#8217;t, there will always be bacteria exposed to sub-lethal levels.  I outline what I think is a better approach here.</p>

<p>Suppressing virulence is just as effective at preventing disease as is killing the infectious agent.  If it is not expressing virulence, then it is not virulent.  Much of what prevents infection is a microbiome of non-pathogenic organisms that suppress pathogens.  Wiping out the commensals in the microbiome leave the equivalent of a clear-cut lifeless moonscape where the ‚Äúweeds‚Äù that grow the fastest come back first, exactly what you don&#8217;t want.  .  </p>

Absolutely. And there are people that know anatomy much better than I do who don‚Äôt know embryo as well as I do. There are multiple ways to skin a cat ‚Äì sometimes even just as effectively. I do not think I can argue that an embryological framework for anatomy or an evolutionary framework for molecular medicine is necessarily even the best way to learn it, let alone the only way to learn it. I would argue it is at least one of the best ways. And I would most certainly argue that an active denial of evolution (rather than mere indifference to it) is certainly a negative when it comes to being a physician (or any kind of scientist, for that matter).

And I agree with you about embryology, but then embryo is considerably less theoretical than evolutionary bio. What do you think?
I think that there exists no field of science that is more supported by rigorous, varied, and converging lines of evidence as evolutionary bio. To say that embryo is less theoretical is incorrect. 
However, because of biochemistry, funded by the NIH and evil medical companies  , we know the importance and pervasiveness of horizontal transfer (viral and other), epigenetics, etc. How do these ideas fit with the traditional picture of vertical transfer and random mutations? However they fit, it‚Äôll be evolutionary theories that need to grapple with the empiricism and constant progress of biochemistry and medical science, not the reverse.
I don‚Äôt see it as separately as you seem to. Biochemistry research is evo bio research as well. Evo is, after all, the central organizing principle of all biology. Hence my comment that being indifferent probably matters very little ‚Äì whether your work explicitly mentions evo or not, the work is still applicable in pretty much every case. My argument (which is indeed my own opinion) is that while indifference matters little, and denial is a negative, that active utilization of the evolutionary framework can be a positive.

That doesn‚Äôt sound so hard a niche to fill. We also need an expansion of NIH funds to fund more phase III trials and FDA paperwork-filling via such companies
Do you live in the US?  How do you feel about higher taxes?  Not bad ideas, but much as private industry is profit-motivated, this provides them an incentive to drive down manufacturing costs.  It‚Äôd be interesting to compare US costs for vaccine production with Danish (Denmark‚Äôs vaccines are produced by a public entity rather than a private company).  
And who knows, maybe one of those contract organizations will evolve into a new competitor to fill the pharma niche. If you want something in the private domain, it has to be possible for it to go broke because of its own mistakes. Especially when those mistakes are criminal.

"344257","163","145950",,"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/21546/",,"as for the ‚Äúbacteria are the basis of chronic disease/cancer/etc‚Äù‚Ä¶.
my take is that they may be a cause, but certainly not a fundamental cause. We understand reasonably well how oncogenesis occurs and in the cases where virus and bacteria have been succesfully implicated in oncogenesis we find that it is because the infection potentiates the mechanisms already in place. I have yet to see an example of any infectious process yielding a completely unique pathway of oncogensis that isn‚Äôt explained by reducing it to already defined and understood principles of cancer biology. 
Specific examples are interesting ‚Äì such as HPV and cervical cancer. There are two main serotypes of HPV that lead to (or cause, if you prefer) cancer. Why do they do so, but all the other myriad serotypes don‚Äôt? Because these two induce the cell to produce proteins which inhibit p53 and Rb ‚Äì two naturally occurring proteins that guard against deleterious cellular mutations. So does the fact that the virus leads to cancer mean a fundamental change in our understanding of cancer biology? No. It just means we have found yet another way in which already understood oncogenic pathways are activated. (Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an inherited defect in p53 which leads to afflicted persons having myriad varied and early cancers). 
I have no doubt that as we understand the microbiome more fully we will find even more examples of such relationships. We may even find novel oncogenic pathways (though I think this is unlikely it is still very much a possibility I am open to). But I think most of what we will find is the interplay leads to a base background level of oncogenesis. Meaning that once we understand and can accurately map out individual microbiomes we will be better able to assign a background risk of cancer to individuals due to their microbiome. And certain pathogens which impart a significantly higher risk (H. pylori, hepatitis, HPV, etc) will be able to be targeted to bring that risk down. 
As for chronic diseases other than cancer ‚Äì say Alzheimers or CAD ‚Äì I am much more skeptical about a specific infectious etiology. Once again, we have a pretty reasonable handle of the genesis of such conditions and while a particular pathogen could accelerate or otherwise potentiate these mechanisms, I am doubtful that we will find a dramatic shift in our understanding such that targeting pathogens will be a primary means to reduce incidence of chronic disease.
","<p>as for the &#8220;bacteria are the basis of chronic disease/cancer/etc&#8221;&#8230;.</p>
<p>my take is that they may be a cause, but certainly not a fundamental cause. We understand reasonably well how oncogenesis occurs and in the cases where virus and bacteria have been succesfully implicated in oncogenesis we find that it is because the infection potentiates the mechanisms already in place. I have yet to see an example of any infectious process yielding a completely unique pathway of oncogensis that isn&#8217;t explained by reducing it to already defined and understood principles of cancer biology. </p>
<p>Specific examples are interesting &#8211; such as HPV and cervical cancer. There are two main serotypes of HPV that lead to (or cause, if you prefer) cancer. Why do they do so, but all the other myriad serotypes don&#8217;t? Because these two induce the cell to produce proteins which inhibit p53 and Rb &#8211; two naturally occurring proteins that guard against deleterious cellular mutations. So does the fact that the virus leads to cancer mean a fundamental change in our understanding of cancer biology? No. It just means we have found yet another way in which already understood oncogenic pathways are activated. (Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an inherited defect in p53 which leads to afflicted persons having myriad varied and early cancers). </p>

I agree. At which point in our evolution should we define as the point on which to base our diet? When did we stop evolving? Because every actual evolutionary scientist is aware that we are still currently evolving. That is the issue I have with the so-called ‚Äúpaleo diet.‚Äù
Realizing that humans have been squatting to defecate for hundreds of thousands of years, and that our modern seated toilets (perhaps in combination with our modern diet) might be responsible for conditions such as diverticulitis and hemorrhoids. 
A simple study would be possible. Compare the incidence of the conditions in populations that regularly squat to defecate (India, France, for example) and us. In a quick search I could find no such studies. But it was a quick search.
What is the blood level of Vitamin D in a human ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù, and is, perhaps, that a better starting point for studies designed to hash out the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù vitamin D level rather than trying to tease the information out from epidemiological studies of populations that are almost uniformly deficient in vitamin D
Besides the fact that we have no way to infer this from a purely evolutionary framework, you must also realize that for any physiological parameter there is no such thing as ‚Äúthe right number.‚Äù We have a range in which 95% of the population will fall via statistical analysis. 2.5% will be above and 2.5% will be below and still be normal and healthy. That also (must) factor in time and variance within an individual ‚Äì what is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for me today is not necessarily ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for me tomorrow. 
Furthermore, we must realize that even if the assumption is correct (which I contend it isn‚Äôt) that a specific period of our history is when our evolution ‚Äústopped‚Äù (or at least slowed to the point that we could reasonably focus on that physiology to try and tailor our lifestyle to) there is a second assumption inherent to that goal ‚Äì that tailoring our lifestyle to those conditions means we would be healthier! Lifespans were incredibly short. Disease and trauma were rampant. The best you could say about an ‚Äúevolutionarily appropriate diet‚Äù is that it would be the one to best achieve fertility and fecundity at an early age. It cannot possibly speak to the ‚Äúbest‚Äù diet to get us to and through our 60‚Äôs, 70‚Äôs, and 80‚Äôs. 
So despite being a staunch evolutionist, I do not see utility in using evolutionary biology to attempt to answer these questions‚Ä¶ at least not from a historical perspective. Doing so is based on wrong assumptions.
I‚Äôm not suggesting that evolutionary medicine alone can offer many answers to our modern medical questions, but it certainly can offer us a perspective from which to think about a lot of medical conditions.
I agree with you there. We can use it to predict future outcomes and tailor new lifestyle regimens and drugs to accomodate our current evolution.

This should have fairly major ramifications in terms of profits, dividends, new investment, share price, R&D and really, most operations.  If fines of this magnitude are applied recurrently, it could very well drive a company out of business in addition to undercutting the major reason why they fund drug reps ‚Äì it drives up profits.  If you get an extra $1B/year using drug reps, but you get a $3B fine, that‚Äôs 3 years of activity and resources utterly wasted.  I‚Äôm pretty darned sure that a $3B fine is a substantial deterrent.  Though I‚Äôve long thought fines should be commensurate with the profits generated by the illegal or fraudulent activity, in some cases that would result in the company being liquidated.  Great for Pfizer and Merck (one less competitor, lots of cheap equipment and a whole host of unemployed talent to hire) but overall perhaps worse for consumers.  Ultimately someone has to manufacture pharmaceuticals.

","<p>jmm, do you think every time a company does something that gets them a fine, they should close shop?  This should have fairly major ramifications in terms of profits, dividends, new investment, share price, R&amp;D and really, most operations.  If fines of this magnitude are applied recurrently, it could very well drive a company out of business in addition to undercutting the major reason why they fund drug reps &#8211; it drives up profits.  If you get an extra $1B/year using drug reps, but you get a $3B fine, that&#8217;s 3 years of activity and resources utterly wasted.  I&#8217;m pretty darned sure that a $3B fine is a substantial deterrent.  Though I&#8217;ve long thought fines should be commensurate with the profits generated by the illegal or fraudulent activity, in some cases that would result in the company being liquidated.  Great for Pfizer and Merck (one less competitor, lots of cheap equipment and a whole host of unemployed talent to hire) but overall perhaps worse for consumers.  Ultimately someone has to manufacture pharmaceuticals.</p>

I believe she says that it is mostly unreliable, but that due to the difficulty of isolating people and controlling their food intake, it is usually all we have. This is one reason that diet research is so difficult.

I wasn‚Äôt aware that the experience of RusticHealthy was valid in all cases, for all persons, irrespective genetics, activity level, medical conditions, geographic location, congenital disorders, liver health and the like.  Should you alert the thousands of reserachers working on weight loss throughout the world that they should change to a new topic because the problem has been solved, or shall I?  
Janet‚Ä¶my experience still stands.
Yes, your experience stands.  But your experience is unique to you and may not work for other people, your description may not accurately represent what actually happened, and what you attribute your weight loss to may not be what caused it.  A point that has been repeated many, many times.  
I lost cravings/obsession when I went organic, cutting out hormones/antibiotics/estrogens/obesogens.
Did you change the amount of processed food you ate?  Did you start cooking your own food?  Did you stop eating out?  Did you get more exercise?  Did you alter your sleep habits?  Change dishes?  Change friends?  Change lifestyle?  Change medication?  Stop or start birth control, start menopause?  Evaluate your diet?  Evaluate your lifestyle?  Are you certain the only thing that changed was the amount of hormones, antibiotics and obesogens that you consumed, but otherwise your calorie count remained the same?  The very act of thinking about things can change behaviour, even if you didn‚Äôt intend it.
Estrogens are hormones by the way, making that part of your statement redundant.
What exactly makes it ‚Äònon-science‚Äô 
How about a different question.  What makes it science?  Why is your experience a better guide for decision making than science?  
‚Ä¶ that it hasn‚Äôt be clinically tested. So you all are that closed to shut everything down without atleast ‚Äòdisproving‚Äô it first?
The burden of proof rests with the individual making the claim.  It‚Äôs not up to us to disprove your hypothesis (which is impossible anyway, theories are not proven or disproven, merely supported or not supported to a greater or lesser extent when tested), it‚Äôs up to you to prove it.
The conventional advice for losing weight is to reduce calorie intake and exercise.  It‚Äôs hard but it works, if followed consistently.  You are making a dramatic claim that by switching to a different (more expensive, much more resource-intensive) source of food your weight loss was easy.  So it‚Äôs up to you to substantiate your claim.  There are an infinite number of possible hypotheses, scientists use pre-existing research (prior probability based on a pretty extensive body of knowledge) to guide their thinking on what to test.  The article you link to isn‚Äôt actually a bad starting point ‚Äì not the article itself, the references (pubmed documents, though a lot of ‚Äúin rats‚Äù studies and people aren‚Äôt rats).  Real scientists look at those references and think ‚Äúthere might be something there, I wonder if it works in people.‚Äù  Jami Cooley, like a lot of people in the alt med world, apparently think rats are the same as people (so long as the study confirms something they thought in the first place) and that a single study is the only thing you need to know about a field.

But <i>your</i> experience is unique to <i>you</i> and may not work for other people, your description may not accurately represent what actually happened, and what you attribute your weight loss to may not be what caused it.  A point that has been repeated many, many times.  </p>
<blockquote><p>I lost cravings/obsession when I went organic, cutting out hormones/antibiotics/estrogens/obesogens.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did you change the amount of processed food you ate?  Did you start cooking your own food?  Did you stop eating out?  Did you get more exercise?  Did you alter your sleep habits?  Change dishes?  Change friends?  Change lifestyle?  Change medication?  Stop or start birth control, start menopause?  Evaluate your diet?  Evaluate your lifestyle?  Are you certain the <i>only thing that changed</i> was the amount of hormones, antibiotics and obesogens that you consumed, but otherwise your calorie count remained the same?  The very act of thinking about things can change behaviour, even if you didn&#8217;t intend it.</p>
<p>Estrogens are hormones by the way, making that part of your statement redundant.</p>
<blockquote><p>What exactly makes it ‚Äònon-science‚Äô </p></blockquote>
<p>How about a different question.  What makes it science?  Why is your experience a better guide for decision making than science?  </p>
<blockquote><p>‚Ä¶ that it hasn‚Äôt be clinically tested. So you all are that closed to shut everything down without atleast ‚Äòdisproving‚Äô it first?</p></blockquote>
<p>The burden of proof rests with the individual making the claim.  It&#8217;s not up to us to disprove your hypothesis (which is impossible anyway, theories are not proven or disproven, merely supported or not supported to a greater or lesser extent when tested), it&#8217;s up to you to prove it.</p>
<p>The conventional advice for losing weight is to reduce calorie intake and exercise.  It&#8217;s hard but it works, if followed consistently.  You are making a dramatic claim that by switching to a different (more expensive, much more resource-intensive) source of food your weight loss was easy.  So it&#8217;s up to you to substantiate your claim.  There are an infinite number of possible hypotheses, scientists use pre-existing research (prior probability based on a pretty extensive body of knowledge) to guide their thinking on what to test.  The article you link to isn&#8217;t actually a bad starting point &#8211; not the article itself, the references (pubmed documents, though a lot of &#8220;in rats&#8221; studies and people aren&#8217;t rats).  Real scientists look at those references and think &#8220;there might be something there, I wonder if it works in people.&#8221;  Jami Cooley, like a lot of people in the alt med world, apparently think rats are the same as people (so long as the study confirms something they thought in the first place) and that a single study is the only thing you need to know about a field.</p>

Either one leaves you unable to eat or drink *anything.*  Absolutely pure water is a chemical which is toxic at sufficient dose.

@Mark: Boyd Eaton wrote what might arguably be the first ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù book in 1988 when he wrote ‚ÄòThe Paleolithic Presciption‚Äô. I‚Äôm not sure when Staffan Lindeberg wrote ‚ÄòFood and Western Diseases‚Äù, but that is another book that considers health and nutrition from an evolutionary perspective. More recently a number of authors have written books about the ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù diet (though others chose not to focus on the term ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù because of the dislike some people have taken towards the name). The most recent book to be broadly accepted by those with an interest in evolutionary nutrition is ‚ÄúIt Starts with Food‚Äù which came out last month. These books are generally meant for the lay public, but the recommendations have been seriously vetted by a number of people with strong science backgrounds. Yes there are people that claim ‚Äúit‚Äôs what a caveman did‚Äù, but the more reasonable (and scientifically minded) use the concept as a framework on which to base a discussion on nutrition, health, and wellness.
If you‚Äôre looking for some references for the apparent effectiveness of a paleo approach, I can offer these papers:
1.	Jonsson, T., Y. Granfeldt, C. Erlanson-Albertsson, B. Ahren, and S. Lindeberg, A paleolithic diet is more satiating per calorie than a mediterranean-like diet in individuals with ischemic heart disease. Nutr Metab (Lond). 7: p. 85.
2.	Jonsson, T., Y. Granfeldt, B. Ahren, U.C. Branell, G. Palsson, A. Hansson, M. Soderstrom, and S. Lindeberg, Beneficial effects of a Paleolithic diet on cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes: a randomized cross-over pilot study. Cardiovasc Diabetol, 2009. 8: p. 35.
3.	Frassetto, L.A., M. Schloetter, M. Mietus-Synder, R.C. Morris, Jr., and A. Sebastian, Metabolic and physiologic improvements from consuming a paleolithic, hunter-gatherer type diet. Eur J Clin Nutr, 2009. 63(8): p. 947-55.
4.	Osterdahl, M., T. Kocturk, A. Koochek, and P.E. Wandell, Effects of a short-term intervention with a paleolithic diet in healthy volunteers. Eur J Clin Nutr, 2008. 62(5): p. 682-5.
There is a lot of research into individual aspects of an evolutionary-appropriate diet, such as the effects of different fatty acids (especially the modern abundance of linoleic acid and the paucity of omega-3s), but the above references look at the ‚Äúpaleo diet‚Äù as a whole.
Honestly- I understand that the term ‚Äúpaleo diet‚Äù may rub people the wrong way, but the suggestion to use evolutionary ideas as a foundation from which to build our scientific exploration seems like a reasonable (indeed the only reasonable) place to start.

The video is‚Ä¶ interesting. And wrong on many points (overlapping with my above comment). First off, TED has gone way downhill ‚Äì used to be an excellent source for new, groundbreaking, interesting, and/or thought provoking stuff. Now with so many spinoffs and so many smaller venues, it has degenerated into anyone who can tell a good yarn. The one about breast imaging via gamma scintigraphy and the one about the kooky physicist who claims to have seen quantum effects on a macroscopic level come to mind. In any event, to address this talk specifically:
Almost everything about our world has changed in the last 10,000 years except our basic physiology
This is not only a statement made on pure assumption (does she have a living person from 10,000 years ago to understand his/her physiology?) but also demonstrably wrong. We live longer, reach menarche and puberty later, reproduce later, experience menopause which never existed till just a hundred+ years ago, still maintain lactase production into adulthood, have a different modulation of our immune system (which is even further changing based on current evolutionary pressures like HIV and other infectious diseases), etc. Once again, the assumption that we are not still currently evolving is simply wrong. And it is the most wrong on a molecular level.
We were created to live in 24 hour cycles of light and dark
I‚Äôll ignore the usage of the word ‚Äúcreated‚Äù here. lol. But, this is also demonstrably false. Studies have shown quite nicely that not only do humans actually have a roughly 25 hour circadian rhythm, but that light can and does readily reset that rhythm to conform to changing light/dark cycles. Furthermore, it used to be considered quite normal for people to actually sleep in two separate ‚Äúcycles‚Äù per day. For quite a long time in the middle ages it was absolutely normal to sleep for a few hours, then wake up and read or be otherwise productive for a couple of hours, and then sleep again for another few hours. This was called ‚Äúsecond sleep‚Äù or ‚Äúsegmented sleep‚Äù and it ceased after the industrial revolution. Many argue that this is the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù or ‚Äúbest‚Äù way to sleep. So who is right?
To work hard physically on a daily basis for food and shelter‚Ä¶
Once again, perhaps she is right. But what does that sort of lifestyle (food/work) select for? Would the Stephen Hawkings of the paleolithic era have existed if we had continued that sort of lifestyle?
When one learns about changing outcomes in complex systems ‚Äì healthcare for instance ‚Äì the first premise is that the system is perfectly designed to generate the outcomes that it does. Replacing one cog of a system for another likely won‚Äôt affect the outcome. So if you are arguing for a system (lifestyle + diet) that was around during the paleolithic era, you are also arguing for those outcomes ‚Äì for us to be like our ancestors. I, for one, am quite glad we have evolved far beyond those cavemen üòâ
‚Ä¶as well as regular exposure to more than 80,000 chemicals we have added to our environment since 1950. BTW, only 10% of those are actually tested for safety. What we do, what we are exposed to, can leaving us feeling tired, depressed, ill, and isolated.
I can not help seeing this as an appea to the ‚Äúoh noes, teh toxins!‚Äù followed up by an evidence free statement of ‚Äúfact.‚Äù In looking at actual data we find that, on the average, the person living in a modern industrialized nation is better off in all these aspects than our forebears a century or two ago (and even further back)(1). I see a few reasonable explanations for this.
One is that we simply are actually better in every way and that everything we are doing is a move in the right direction. This has allowed Maslow to speak through his hierarchy. A century ago there were much more immediately pertinent things to complain about than tiredness and depression and isolation. Now, we have it so much better that we have the time to complain about these things. (First world problems, as it were).
The second would be that we have traded the tiredness, depression, illness, and isolation of rampant disease, death, trauma, and war for the much lower levels of the same from our current lifestyle.
Either way I see it as an improvement over our ancestors and trying to advocate going back in time to model ourselves after them seems‚Ä¶ well, backwards. 
‚Ä¶ there is a chasm between the life we and environment that we evolved to thrive in‚Ä¶
Once again ‚Äì this is a false appeal. Considering that the total human population never exeeded 50 million worldwide until around the time of the Black Death (at which point roughly 50% of the entire world population died) and that the average life expectancy was somewhere between 20‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs for the vast majority of our history as a species I would hardly say that such hyperbolic claims are warranted. We did not thrive we scraped out an existence. Now is when we are thriving. We definitely love to romanticize the past ‚Äì just look at the common motifs for shows of the 1950‚Äôs or most movies, shows, and plays about the medieval times. They are usually portrayed as happy times of chivalry and intrigue, simple times when people were happier without all the burdens of modern life. Shows like ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù are a much more accurate depiction. 
‚Ä¶the most shocking example of this is that we will live longer lives longer lives than our children will for the first time in our country‚Ä¶
This is not an entirely accurate depiction. First off, there is contention as to whether this is actually true or not(2). Secondly, it is primarily an issue of obesity and primarily only in the US. Most other developed nations have longer life expectancies than us and are expected to continue increasing in that life expectancy(3). And lastly, the latest data from the CDC and DHHS states otherwise ‚Äì that we can continue to expect to see increased life expectancy (albeit at a slower rate of increase than before)(4).
Life Expectancy in years  Figure 1/Table 22
At birth  76.8 (2000)  77.9 (2007)  78.5 (2009)
At 65 years  17.6 (2000)  18.6 (2007)  19.2 (2009)
She then goes on to talk about the diseases of our modern world. Yes ‚Äì she is correct that people are dying of these things (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, etc) at much higher rates than ever before. But that is what we have traded for an overall decrease in death from all other causes. There is a great little table in the recent NEJM about how we die differently over the last 200 years(5).
This is only 2.5 minutes into the 7.5 minute talk (which I did watch in its entirety). She goes on to appeal to emotion (‚Äúas a mother of three I find this frightening‚Äù) and further hyperbolic statements. 
I have to head off to clinic soon so I will leave it at that (I also reckon most people wouldn‚Äôt care to read through this treatise I just wrote anyways).
TL;DR: I think that the issue with the Paleo diet and other such ‚Äúevolutionary‚Äù considerations is that the focus is misplaced on the past and some (falsely) idealized notion of what our physiology and environment were like back then rather than looking to the future and realizing that we are still currently evolving. That and TED talks have become more sensational with appeals to emotion lacking rigorous evidence to back them up, which I hope I reasonably demonstrated above.

2) Tangential obesity question I‚Äôve been worried about‚Ä¶I‚Äôm constantly hearing people gain weight after quitting smoking because of nicotine‚Äôs effect on the deiodinases. Can anyone speak about this (specifically whether nicotine in fact increases conversion to T3)?

","<p>Great post&#8230;very fun read. I have a couple curious questions:</p>
<p>1) On what inclusion/exclusion criteria would you guys and gals focus for a weightloss study?</p>
<p>2) Tangential obesity question I&#8217;ve been worried about&#8230;I&#8217;m constantly hearing people gain weight after quitting smoking because of nicotine&#8217;s effect on the deiodinases. Can anyone speak about this (specifically whether nicotine in fact increases conversion to T3)? I found some compelling evidence on pubmed, but other conflicting evidence&#8230;lots of rat studies, in vivo, etc. Some give the idea nicotine really suppresses thyroid function.

I was merely commenting that it is possible that instead of spending hundreds of years doing something we are not adapted to handle (sitting instead of squatting) it is also quite plausible that in hundreds of years we are no longer adapted to squat any longer and are better suited to sit. 
The argument was posed that we should go back to squatting since our bodies evolved to do that ‚Äì all I was saying is ‚ÄúWhere is the evidence that we didn‚Äôt adapt (evolve) to be sitters in modern times?‚Äù 
In my mind though, there is much more to it than musculoskeletal issues. Changes in the size, thickness, and distribution of blood vessels to the rectum and rest of the GI tract might be present to accomodate the ‚Äúnew‚Äù way of taking care of business. Different neural responses to varying intra abdominal pressures ‚Äì both in the enteric and central nervous system ‚Äì could be present. Different length of time between migratory motor complexes could have evolved. 
This is all speculation of course and I am just listing various physiological parameters. But the point I was trying to make is that it is more complicated than just thinking about hip flexors. And the further consideration is that we may be in a state that is less ideally suited to deal with squatting and not ideally suited for sitting. It could be a wash and if we all start squatting we will merely trade one set of associated problems for another. 
The point is that we can‚Äôt infer these sorts of things from an evolutionary framework because there are too many plausible narratives (one has to remember that evolution and adaptation work to the best solution for the current challenge building from the previous state of the organism ‚Äì thus we cannot infer what ‚Äúideal‚Äù would mean and often not even what ‚Äúbetter‚Äù would be since there are many intermediate states of adaptation that an organism can occupy). If we could compare ourselves to our medieval ancestors then we would have a different case. Until then, all if this is speculation at best. 
However it seems implausible sitting, or many other parts of our life, are something to which we‚Äôre ‚Äúadapted‚Äù in the Darwinist/biology-class sense (tho I‚Äôm open to hear otherwise). 
I don‚Äôt see it as particularly implausible ‚Äì all that evolution is is the placement of an organism of a fitness landscape with many different peaks and valleys and flat space. An organism can move in 3 dimensions on this landscape and adapt in myriad different ways. 
But I don‚Äôt think the more general view (there‚Äôre certain aspects of present life to which we haven‚Äôt adapted from the immediate past, that we‚Äôd be better off without) is as bad in some non-diet cases
Agreed. I also think it is reasonable to say that there are aspects of our diet to which we may not have ‚Äúadapted‚Äù ‚Äì D2U gave a great example. We haven‚Äôt yet fully adapted to a plentiful (essentially unlimited) diet. Hence obesity. But some of us have since there are people who are still thin and fit without having to think too much about it, despite others of us being quite obese or having to work very hard at staying fit (just as an example).
 I‚Äôm reading you as saying you think the more general ‚Äúpaleo‚Äù view is almost always a bad view, or at least almost always dubious. Is that right?
I would say generally always dubious. The problem being that we simply cannot infer and have no direct way of saying how, exactly, our biological state has differed from any point in the past. However, evidence shows us that we have indeed changed. And even if that is only a partial change (i.e. arguably not ‚Äúfully‚Äù adapted to modern times ‚Äì whatever that may mean) it is still a different state from the past and thus trying to argue that living/eating as our ancestors still just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. That is, of course, assuming we can fully describe and have available to us what our ancestors actually ate.
Since we still don‚Äôt have the evidence for the controversial premise, and since you‚Äôre a professional, I‚Äôll leave you the last word. Been fun going back and forth‚Ä¶.
Indeed, it has been. And you are too kind. I am just sussing out ideas and finding the argument of trying to re-create living conditions of our ancestors for health benefits to be highly dubious at best.

We, as humans, eat excessively period, especially in the US. These vague, nonspecific ‚Äúchemicals and toxins‚Äù (which you still seem to missing a step in logic by not understanding, after being told repeatedly that EVERYTHING is made of chemicals and has toxicity) you‚Äôre referring to, are new stimuli as a result of industrialized society. The same ‚Äúchemicals and toxins‚Äù you interact with on a daily basis via driving, using anything made with plastic, using shampoo and body wash, being in your home, going to any random building, etc. We interact with these new stimuli on a daily basis. Buying foods you THINK are ‚Äúorganic‚Äù or ‚Äúall-natural‚Äù (in reality are by majority cross-breeds and still go through processing, encountering many pathogens and ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù) doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt interacting with those ‚Äúchemicals and toxins‚Äù. 
Maybe if I explain what I (my opinion, nothing substantiated as factual) feel is lacking in our healthcare system. I see three things lacking in our system. One is in-clinic patient education. Whether due to higher quantity and rushed exams or general laziness, the practitioners generally don‚Äôt spend extra time educating the patient about their particular condition, and even if they do the patients don‚Äôt understand or even attempt to understand. Which brings me to the second thing lacking, patient compliance. The general population knows what‚Äôs ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù to eat and do. The information is there, but do they listen? CAM capitalizes on this and rolls in the money. The CAM industry spends a lot of marketing telling people that ‚Äúwestern‚Äù medicine doesn‚Äôt teach or give this information, while they steal the info from scientists doing the actual work getting their hands dirty in labs confirming their hypotheses, while they claim rights to them and do nothing to prove their claims. The third component is preventative measures. Again, the information is there, but it is often not relayed to the patient (pt ed) and even when they hear it, they don‚Äôt comply. So, do you have recommendations to fix these issues? Propaganda documentaries to spread various conspiracies, while fitting in some small beneficial nutritional info? A large portion of the population can‚Äôt afford or have access to many nutritional needs. Everyone seeks to blame something. I blame the monetary system. I could spends days ranting about how much I hate the monetary system, but I will avoid it here.
We are a lazy, conformist species of followers seeking guidance and authority. When we find that authority, we feel it gives us right to make claims with certainty whether it‚Äôs legitimate or not. Religion, conspiracy theories, and other various ideologies are examples. WLU mentioned ‚Äúnear-religion‚Äù. I would take it a step further and say it is religion. A faith-based ideology that relies on supernatural components as confirmation of it‚Äôs ‚Äúreality‚Äù. CAM is by this definition, and it‚Äôs actual definition, a religion. The people (generalized I know) that strictly do the ‚Äúorganic‚Äù lifestyle end up believing that these foods do miraculous, unfounded, and sometimes supernatural things. They flock together, hold non-‚Äúmainstream‚Äù ideologies, hold holier-than-thou (thanks WLU) attitudes toward those that don‚Äôt believe what they believe, have anecdotal testimony that this specific thing caused their benefits while ignoring other factors, etc. It is a religion. WLU made the other obvious points that are often ignored by proponents of CAM and ‚Äúall-natural‚Äù lifestyles. One thing I
ve learned interacting with religious folk and conspiracy theorists, is that one can‚Äôt change others beliefs especially if they are enabled by others. If those ‚Äúothers‚Äù are proclaimed ‚Äúexperts‚Äù or have ‚ÄúDr.‚Äù in front of their name, and goes against ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù (‚Äúbig pharma‚Äù ‚Äúshills‚Äù), these people will believe every word that comes out of their mouth. We don‚Äôt put emphasis on the scientific method and critical thinking. Even many of those that proclaim ‚Äúcritical thinking‚Äù like many conspiracy theorists, neglect the scientific method/analytical thought and still go by intuition. Rambling again‚Ä¶

<p>We are a lazy, conformist species of followers seeking guidance and authority. When we find that authority, we feel it gives us right to make claims with certainty whether it&#8217;s legitimate or not. Religion, conspiracy theories, and other various ideologies are examples. WLU mentioned &#8220;near-religion&#8221;. I would take it a step further and say it is religion. A faith-based ideology that relies on supernatural components as confirmation of it&#8217;s &#8220;reality&#8221;. <abbr title=""Complementary and Alternative Medicine"">CAM</abbr> is by this definition, and it&#8217;s actual definition, a religion. The people (generalized I know) that strictly do the &#8220;organic&#8221; lifestyle end up believing that these foods do miraculous, unfounded, and sometimes supernatural things. They flock together, hold non-&#8220;mainstream&#8221; ideologies, hold holier-than-thou (thanks WLU) attitudes toward those that don&#8217;t believe what they believe, have anecdotal testimony that this specific thing caused their benefits while ignoring other factors, etc. It is a religion. WLU made the other obvious points that are often ignored by proponents of <abbr title=""Complementary and Alternative Medicine"">CAM</abbr> and &#8220;all-natural&#8221; lifestyles. One thing I<br />
ve learned interacting with religious folk and conspiracy theorists, is that one can&#8217;t change others beliefs especially if they are enabled by others. If those &#8220;others&#8221; are proclaimed &#8220;experts&#8221; or have &#8220;Dr.&#8221; in front of their name, and goes against &#8220;mainstream&#8221; (&#8220;big pharma&#8221; &#8220;shills&#8221;), these people will believe every word that comes out of their mouth. We don&#8217;t put emphasis on the scientific method and critical thinking. Even many of those that proclaim &#8220;critical thinking&#8221; like many conspiracy theorists, neglect the scientific method/analytical thought and still go by intuition. Rambling again&#8230;</p>

I don‚Äôt think anyone that really ‚Äúthinks‚Äù about evolutionary nutrition would ever say that humans have STOPPED evolving. What we might suggest, however, is that for many people there has been insufficient time and evolutionary pressure for complete adaptation to the products of the agricultural revolution
The highlighted part is a very, very reasonable argument. One that I (indirectly) addressed previously:
Furthermore, we must realize that even if the assumption is correct (which I contend it isn‚Äôt) that a specific period of our history is when our evolution ‚Äústopped‚Äù (or at least slowed to the point that we could reasonably focus on that physiology to try and tailor our lifestyle to)‚Ä¶
The inherent and necessary assumption in my bolded part is that the selective pressure on us remitted sufficiently to be a reasonable focus for when to use as our model of health behaviours/foods. The remainder of what I said took into account that as being true and still found fault with it. 
Furthermore, you said it yourself: complete adaptation. My argument does not in any way require complete adaptation. However yours (well, the argument for returning to ‚Äúevolutionarily appropriate lifestyles‚Äù) does require that we haven‚Äôt evolved/adapted at all. 
Because even if we only partly adapted that still means an ‚Äúevolutionarily appropriate lifestyle‚Äù makes no sense. You could argue (and I would be hard pressed to disagree) that we aren‚Äôt well adapted to our current lifestyle. But the argument you (and Rachel Abrams of the TED talk) need to be making in order to convince me is that we are still best adapted for a historical lifestyle. And I can‚Äôt see how that argument can be made ‚Äì especially since nobody can give any good rationale for picking a specific timeframe to point at as ‚Äúbest.‚Äù Should we be looking pre- or post-industrial revolution? During the feudal times? Roman Empire? Greek? Before Common Era? Even further back? When did the selective pressure remit enough that you can say ‚ÄúYes, that is the timeframe to which we are still best adapted‚Äù
The point is that we have evolved and still currently are. So it makes very little sense to me to try and go back in time to model how we should eat and live. We may not be ideally suited to modern lifestyles, but I would argue that we are still currently best suited for it (or at least as ideally suited as we would be for an ancient lifestyle, whichever one you wish to pick). Best case scenario then, is that one is then forced to say something like, ‚ÄúWe are still mostly adapted for [X] timeframe but with [Y] and [Z] changes‚Äù which then becomes a conversation about our current state. Of course, we can‚Äôt even infer X, Y, or Z to begin with so it is entirely a moot point. 
If you study a bunch of people with anemia you might think that a hemoglobin of 8 is pretty darn good, and when compared to someone with a hemoglobin of 5 they‚Äôre probably going to look a whole lot better, but unless you look at normal people you may not realize that your HgB of 8 is actually pretty sub optimal compared to those within the true‚Äúnormal‚Äù range.
Indeed. And the part I neglected to include in my comment was that we look at ‚Äúnormal‚Äù populations ‚Äì i.e. asymptomatic individuals since defining ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to begin with is not as straighforward as one might imagine. And that was my point ‚Äì different populations have different ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Men have different cutoffs for anemia than women and pregnant women different still. And we may diagnose anemia but never treat it since the person is asymptomatic. From an evolutionary standpoint anything that doesn‚Äôt decrease your fertility and fecundity is still ‚Äúnormal‚Äù so using that to infer ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù physiological states is also impossible.
Which brings me right back to the original point I made in the passage where I quoted myself above ‚Äì looking back in time to try and make an evolutionary fit (even if it were possible) can only speak to re-creating the conditions and states of that time. Perhaps a vitamin D level of [X] is evolutionarily ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I would argue that we don‚Äôt actually necessarily want to be evolutionarily ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Aubrey de Grey says it well when he talks about aging. Right now, we consider it great if grandpa is walking without assistance, mentating clearly, and able to live on his own at 80 or 90. Is it unreasonable to think we could reach a state where grandpa should still be running sub-7 minute miles and a marathon or two? Evolution would not select for that ability ‚Äì especially in modern times. Yet I would love to see people living that healthily to that late an age as the norm. 
We are in a unique position to go past our evolution and to make our own selective pressures for future evolution. I just find the concept of trying to go back to ancestral states of living as pointless in addition to nonsensical. 
Oh, and as for the longevity argument. @nybgrus- you said it yourself. People died of trauma and disease- things we have Emergency rooms, trauma surgeons, vaccinations, and antibiotics for today.
Indeed. And those changes have completely changed the selective pressure on our species. 
This is another opportunity to combine ancestral health with evolutionary medicine- look at humans living ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù today‚Ä¶ If they make it past childhood, they‚Äôre fit and healthy‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre not dropping dead of heart attacks in their 40s.
Well, first off we aren‚Äôt dropping dead of heart attacks in our 40‚Äôs these days either. But the notion that ‚Äúwild‚Äù populations of people (which typically refer to things like Amazonian and African tribes still living in thatch huts and living as hunter-gatherers) are quite healthy if they live past childhood is simply incorrect. There is no evidence support that claim and plenty to demonstrate that they still suffer from chronic diseases, arthralgias, cancers, heart attacks, etc. The indidence and prevalence tend to be lower since they don‚Äôt live as long and because they tend not to be diagnosed and treated. 
Heck even the ancient Egyptians had coronary artery disease. One of my old mentors (whom I‚Äôll be having brunch with in a week) actually went to Egypt and did scans on the vessels of mummies in the museums. They definitely had coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease. And these were ancient people who were also young and had extensive atherosclerosis. So yes, these ancient ‚Äúwild‚Äù folks probably would have been ‚Äúdropping dead of heart attacks in their 40‚Äôs‚Äù
I simply don‚Äôt see a good argument for any particular benefits of trying to implement ancient lifestyles to address modern human health problems.

<p>Furthermore, you said it yourself: <i>complete adaptation</i>. My argument does not in any way require <i>complete</i> adaptation. However yours (well, the argument for returning to &#8220;evolutionarily appropriate lifestyles&#8221;) does require that we haven&#8217;t evolved/adapted <i>at all</i>. </p>
<p>Because even if we only <i>partly</i> adapted that still means an &#8220;evolutionarily appropriate lifestyle&#8221; makes no sense. You could argue (and I would be hard pressed to disagree) that we aren&#8217;t well adapted to our current lifestyle. But the argument you (and Rachel Abrams of the TED talk) need to be making in order to convince me is that we are <i>still</i> <b>best</b> adapted for a historical lifestyle. And I can&#8217;t see how that argument can be made &#8211; especially since nobody can give any good rationale for picking a specific timeframe to point at as &#8220;best.&#8221; Should we be looking pre- or post-industrial revolution? During the feudal times? Roman Empire? Greek? Before Common Era? Even further back? When did the selective pressure remit enough that you can say &#8220;Yes, that is the timeframe to which we are <i>still</i> best adapted&#8221;</p>
<p>The point is that we <i>have</i> evolved and still currently are. So it makes very little sense to me to try and go back in time to model how we should eat and live. We may not be <i>ideally</i> suited to modern lifestyles, but I would argue that we are still currently <i>best</i> suited for it (or at least as ideally suited as we would be for an ancient lifestyle, whichever one you wish to pick). Best case scenario then, is that one is then forced to say something like, &#8220;We are still <i>mostly</i> adapted for [X] timeframe but with [Y] and [Z] changes&#8221; which then becomes a conversation about our current state. Of course, we can&#8217;t even infer X, Y, or Z to begin with so it is entirely a moot point. </p>
<blockquote><p>If you study a bunch of people with anemia you might think that a hemoglobin of 8 is pretty darn good, and when compared to someone with a hemoglobin of 5 they‚Äôre probably going to look a whole lot better, but unless you look at normal people you may not realize that your HgB of 8 is actually pretty sub optimal compared to those within the true‚Äúnormal‚Äù range.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed. And the part I neglected to include in my comment was that we look at &#8220;normal&#8221; populations &#8211; i.e. asymptomatic individuals since defining &#8220;normal&#8221; to begin with is not as straighforward as one might imagine. And that was my point &#8211; different populations have different &#8220;normal.&#8221; Men have different cutoffs for anemia than women and pregnant women different still. And we may diagnose anemia but never treat it since the person is asymptomatic. From an evolutionary standpoint anything that doesn&#8217;t decrease your fertility and fecundity is still &#8220;normal&#8221; so using that to infer &#8220;correct&#8221; physiological states is also impossible.</p>
<p>Which brings me right back to the original point I made in the passage where I quoted myself above &#8211; looking back in time to try and make an evolutionary fit (even if it were possible) can only speak to re-creating the conditions and states of that time. Perhaps a vitamin D level of [X] is evolutionarily &#8220;normal.&#8221; I would argue that we don&#8217;t actually necessarily <i>want</i> to be evolutionarily &#8220;normal.&#8221; Aubrey de Grey says it well when he talks about aging. Right now, we consider it great if grandpa is walking without assistance, mentating clearly, and able to live on his own at 80 or 90. Is it unreasonable to think we could reach a state where grandpa should still be running sub-7 minute miles and a marathon or two? Evolution would not select for that ability &#8211; especially in modern times. Yet I would love to see people living that healthily to that late an age as the norm. </p>
<p>We are in a unique position to go <i>past</i> our evolution and to make our own selective pressures for future evolution. I just find the concept of trying to go <i>back</i> to ancestral states of living as pointless in addition to nonsensical. </p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, and as for the longevity argument. @nybgrus- you said it yourself. People died of trauma and disease- things we have Emergency rooms, trauma surgeons, vaccinations, and antibiotics for today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed. And those changes have completely changed the selective pressure on our species. </p>
<blockquote><p>This is another opportunity to combine ancestral health with evolutionary medicine- look at humans living ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù today‚Ä¶ If they make it past childhood, they‚Äôre fit and healthy‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre not dropping dead of heart attacks in their 40s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, first off we aren&#8217;t dropping dead of heart attacks in our 40&#8217;s these days either. But the notion that &#8220;wild&#8221; populations of people (which typically refer to things like Amazonian and African tribes still living in thatch huts and living as hunter-gatherers) are quite healthy if they live past childhood is simply incorrect. There is no evidence support that claim and plenty to demonstrate that they still suffer from chronic diseases, arthralgias, cancers, heart attacks, etc. The indidence and prevalence tend to be lower since they don&#8217;t live as long and because they tend not to be diagnosed and treated. </p>
<p>Heck even the ancient Egyptians had coronary artery disease. One of my old mentors (whom I&#8217;ll be having brunch with in a week) actually went to Egypt and did scans on the vessels of mummies in the museums. They definitely had <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/14194-egyptian-mummy-heart-disease.html"" rel=""nofollow"">coronary artery</a> and peripheral vascular disease. And these were ancient people who were also <i>young</i> and had <i>extensive</i> atherosclerosis. So yes, these ancient &#8220;wild&#8221; folks probably would have been &#8220;dropping dead of heart attacks in their 40&#8217;s&#8221;</p>
<p>I simply don&#8217;t see a good argument for any particular benefits of trying to implement ancient lifestyles to address modern human health problems.</p>

Wrong.  Processed foods are convenient.  Bread is processed, and a whole lot more convenient and delicious than wheat berries.  Cooked tomatoes are more nutritious than raw tomatoes.  Processed foods that are low in nutrients and high in simple sugars and fats should be eaten in moderation.  Absolutes do not serve anyone, and there is no magic formula, food or nutrient that will make you lose weight (though amphetamines are probably close).

Great book, and well organized, although, I haven‚Äôt read every chapter I have learned quite a bit from the chapters I have read.
I think one of the key points that I have learned is the concept of mismatch.  This is the idea that the genome or the developmental programming of the epigenome can be mismatched with the individual‚Äôs ultimate environment. 
 A quick example would be the Dutch babies born during a famine period of WWII.  These babies underwent a developmental programming that took into account a lack of food, and their physiology was altered in a way to deal with this.  But as they grew up there was no lack of food, and therefore a statistically significant number of these children suffered from obesity.  There was a mismatch between their developmental environment and their ultimate environment.
WRT to the concept of evolutionary diet, I think this is a reasonable and plausible avenue to explore.  99.99% of human evolution has occurred with a diet solely based on whole unprocessed foods.  In such a short time (evolutionarily speaking) have humans adopted a diet high in processed foods, there is no way that the genome could possibly change this quickly to adapt to these massive changes in diet, evolution happens on a much longer time scale.  Now, that is not to say that there is some magical ‚Äúpaleo-diet‚Äù that will match your genome to your current environment, but it is highly likely that you will be more healthy if you consume a diet solely based on whole foods, which I don‚Äôt see anyone arguing against.
One other example I remember reading in some pubmed papers on paleo diet is the change in consumption of Potassium compared to Sodium.  Whereas, the majority of human existence was dominated by a consumption of roughly 100:1 times more Potassium than Sodium, now, the ratio is flip flopped and the modern human consumes roughly 100 times more Sodium than Potassium.  This is another mismatch that the human genome is dealing with and has difficult to quantify implications for modern human health and disease.
One of the other difficult to quantify changes that has been ushered in due to changing diet and lifestyle is the changing human microbiome.  The microbes that reside in our gut feed off of the food we eat, and therefore it is logical to expect this resident flora to also change when the diet changes substantially.  What are the implications of this mismatched microbiome and metabalome on the development of the human immune system?  As D2U brought up, the skin flora has undergone massive changes in an evolutionary blink of an eye due to changing hygiene.  What are the implications of this on human physiology?
Evolutionary medicine doesn‚Äôt need to be used as an afterthought to explain something, but it does provide a great framework for developing testable hypotheses that will accelerate the optimization of medicine.

Arguing, as I do, that RCTs are superior to uncontrolled, informal observations is not the same as arguing that RCTs are perfect, which you seem to be implying I claimed. There is no question RCTs have many weaknesses, and those of us writing here regularly acknowledge that. They are simply better than the alternatives the ‚Äúwoomeisters‚Äù are offering.
There is also no doubt that truly individualized therapy, which could effectively account for all the relevant variation between individuals in their illness and response to therapy, would be a great thing. We aren‚Äôt there yet,and it looks to be quite a ways off, but it‚Äôs certainly a worthy goal. That, however, has little to do with the fake individualization that characterizes TCM, homeopathy, and many other forms of alt med. Pretending to individualize therapy while really just extrapolating from past cases is not an improvement over relying on RCTs, with all their flaws.

Well, and, I‚Äôve repeatedly been saying..I don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt/refuse to see how organic natural foods have the same Toxicity/chemicals as other toxic/chemical/man-made substances. 
Honestly it‚Äôs hard not to flat-out insult you when you say things like this, but the editors have expressed a preference that be avoided.  So I‚Äôll ask a question.  Would you eat an organically grown Amanita phalloides?  It‚Äôs natural, so it‚Äôs got to be harmless.  Right?
I‚Äôm not sure how difficult that is to see..it‚Äôs amusing to me frankly. Maybe that‚Äôs my ‚Äúorganic‚Äù nature coming out
It‚Äôs frustrating for everyone else, not amusing.  You‚Äôre reveling in your ignorance and not bothering to even register the fact that you‚Äôre wrong, repeating the same mistakes and factual inaccuracies again and again, and don‚Äôt bother learning anything new.  It‚Äôs like constantly having to read posts about how jet fuel isn‚Äôt hot enough to melt steel and therefore 9/11 was an inside job, despite being told repeatedly that the heat was more than enough to plasticize the beams.  You‚Äôve made your decision to believe what you want, why are you bothering to discuss it anywhere?  You‚Äôre not going to convince anyone here, the other posters know what a chemical is.  You don‚Äôt.  There is genuinely no merit to you posting here, every time you just demonstrate once more that you have nothing to contribute factually and can‚Äôt form logical arguments even with your flawed facts.
I know actually, that‚Äôs why I cut out as many toxins in shampoos, soaps, cleaning products, etc. as I can..‚Äùless is more‚Äù..so to speak:)
Do you know anything about the safety testing that goes into the ingredients in cosmetics, soaps and the like?  
You‚Äôre right, most are obstinate, pigheaded, undisciplined..etc.. Actually, I tried staying as natural and ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù as I could all these years..except, once in a while anyway..but, none of it helped the craving/obsession..until I went organic, for some weird strange reason,
Confirmation bias, that‚Äôs the reason.  I like how you included ‚Äúundisciplined‚Äù in there.  Do you see the contradiction in your own posts?  On one hand you are claiming people are fat because of pesticides and toxins, and here you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre just lazy.  
except, then I find out that non-organic ‚Äúnatural‚Äù ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù foods contain all kinds of hormones/antibiotics/pesticides and Obesogens.. that promote weight gain and obesity! They in themselves are producing the obesity and other health problems in America.
You think that they promote obesity, rat studies and speculation are not a substitute for real evidence.  You don‚Äôt think that perhaps access to cheap food and reduced exercise are responsible for obesity?
wait, those same scientists that work for pharmas?..hmmm..and‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt endorse any and all CAMs, I don‚Äôt know them all‚Ä¶ only the things that have worked (what I‚Äôve been able to ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù for myself  see my website:)
‚ÄúBig Pharma‚Äù isn‚Äôt an argument, it‚Äôs something intellectually lazy people say to avoid having to actually think about the claims being made.  Not to mention all those vitamins you are so proud of are produced by the exact same ‚ÄúBig Pharma‚Äù you‚Äôre demonizing here.  Big Pharma loves vitamins because they are cheap to produce and require exactly zero research investment, but credulous fools buy them anyway.  
Not to mention, and I‚Äôve said this before, your argument is extremely hypocritical and cherry-picked.  You‚Äôll happily cite research that reinforces your prejudices, claim bias against Big Pharma, and ignore the fact that your preferred sources of information, Mercola, Null and the like, sell supplements and products on their websites.  The difference, of course, is that Mercola, Null and their ilk have no scientists working for them, they just say whatever they think will make you buy their products.

It&#8217;s like constantly having to read posts about how jet fuel isn&#8217;t hot enough to melt steel and therefore 9/11 was an inside job, despite being told repeatedly that the heat was more than enough to plasticize the beams.  You&#8217;ve made your decision to believe what you want, why are you bothering to discuss it anywhere?  You&#8217;re not going to convince anyone here, the other posters know what a chemical is.  You don&#8217;t.  There is genuinely no merit to you posting here, every time you just demonstrate once more that you have nothing to contribute factually and can&#8217;t form logical arguments even with your flawed facts.</p>
<blockquote><p>I know actually, that‚Äôs why I cut out as many toxins in shampoos, soaps, cleaning products, etc. as I can..‚Äùless is more‚Äù..so to speak:)</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you know anything about the safety testing that goes into the ingredients in cosmetics, soaps and the like?  </p>
<blockquote><p>You‚Äôre right, most are obstinate, pigheaded, undisciplined..etc.. Actually, I tried staying as natural and ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù as I could all these years..except, once in a while anyway..but, none of it helped the craving/obsession..until I went organic, for some weird strange reason,</p></blockquote>
<p>Confirmation bias, that&#8217;s the reason.  I like how you included &#8220;undisciplined&#8221; in there.  Do you see the contradiction in your own posts?  On one hand you are claiming people are fat because of pesticides and toxins, and here you&#8217;re saying they&#8217;re just lazy.  </p>
<blockquote><p>except, then I find out that non-organic ‚Äúnatural‚Äù ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù foods contain all kinds of hormones/antibiotics/pesticides and Obesogens.. that promote weight gain and obesity! They in themselves are producing the obesity and other health problems in America.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>You</i> think that they promote obesity, rat studies and speculation are not a substitute for real evidence.  You don&#8217;t think that perhaps access to cheap food and reduced exercise are responsible for obesity?</p>
<blockquote><p>wait, those same scientists that work for pharmas?..hmmm..and‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt endorse any and all CAMs, I don‚Äôt know them all‚Ä¶ only the things that have worked (what I‚Äôve been able to ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù for myself  see my website:)</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Big Pharma&#8221; isn&#8217;t an argument, it&#8217;s something intellectually lazy people say to avoid having to actually think about the claims being made.  Not to mention all those vitamins you are so proud of are produced by the exact same &#8220;Big Pharma&#8221; you&#8217;re demonizing here.  Big Pharma loves vitamins because they are cheap to produce and require exactly zero research investment, but credulous fools buy them anyway.  </p>
<p>Not to mention, and I&#8217;ve said this before, your argument is extremely hypocritical and cherry-picked.  You&#8217;ll happily cite research that reinforces your prejudices, claim bias against Big Pharma, and ignore the fact that your preferred sources of information, Mercola, Null and the like, sell supplements and products on their websites.  The difference, of course, is that Mercola, Null and their ilk have <i>no</i> scientists working for them, they just say whatever they think will make you buy their products.</p>

I am a sucker for people asking good questions with a genuine desire to learn. That and I am honestly not feeling well and my eyes are bleary from staring at APACHE scores for most of the day after attending a funeral which left me feeling‚Ä¶ odd. (I won‚Äôt go into the details of it all, but suffice it to say the deceased was not particularly close to me and I was reminded yet again of why I don‚Äôt like religious ceremonies).
In any event, I researched your question as a means of ‚Äúproductive procrastination‚Äù üòÄ It was reasonably easy to come to a conclusion (not that I am saying it is definitely so, but the pubmed review all seemed to point me in the same direction).
Since I will include many links, I will do it in a second comment to follow as a references cited. (also note that most data is from rat studies, though there are some that correlate the findings to humans)
First off, I found no evidence that the acute exposure of nicotine has any effect on plasma levels of  T3 or T4. From a 1983 (1):
‚ÄúNicotine did not alter the plasma levels of either of the thyroid hormones but did produce a significant increase in plasma corticosterone, an effect which peaked at 20 min post-injection and lasted for 45 min.‚Äù
However, a 1984 article (2) seems to indicate that chronic exposure to nicotine can alter levels, but it shifts the balance towards T4 except in administration of a particular isoform of nicotine. They hypothesize that this is because of back conversion to nicotine (i.e. it enters the T3/T4/rT3 biosynthetic pathway and alters the rate and quantity of reactions by becoming a reactant itself).
‚ÄúThese findings indicate that specific nicotine metabolites alter thyroid hormone concentrations after chronic low-dose administration and possibly do so through back conversion to the parent compound, nicotine.‚Äù
However, more recent data all seem to point to the fact that nicotine itself is not the compound responsible for changes in thyroid hormones ‚Äì the commonest compound implicated is thiocyanate which prevents uptake of iodine as well as its organification. A 1998 article (3) points this out clearly:
‚Äù Increased concentrations of the known goitrogen thiocyanate, generated from cigarette smoke, have been the major explanation for the decreased thyroid function in these women but do not explain the reported increased peripheral markers of hypothyroidism.‚Äù
and
‚ÄúThese studies provide strong evidence that nicotine is not responsible for the observed adverse effects of smoking on the thyroid in humans.‚Äù
Other data seems to echo the thiocyante connection, which is also bolstered by a basic science plausibility.
In even more recent human studies we find that this general theme ‚Äì that it is something other than nicotine that causes the thyroid alteration ‚Äì hold true. From a 2005 study (4):
‚ÄúFurthermore, current nicotine exposure regimens did not alter the total T4 level, T3 uptake and the calculated Free T4 index. The present findings are in agreement with some clinical studies reporting a higher body weight among children born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. Furthermore, the data on thyroid status suggest that cigarette smoking-induced alterations in thyroid status might be mediated through compounds in cigarettes other than nicotine.‚Äù
There is, however, some evidence that nicotine can affect thryoid hormone production by acting upstream on glial cells (brain cells) that contain deiodinase by affecting their function by binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors  that are upstream of this. Put more simply, the nicotine doesn‚Äôt directly affect the deiodinases in the cells, but does affect the cells themselves, which cause them to fire and thus alter the activity of the deiodinase in the downstream cells. This leads to decreased levels of intracellular T4 which makes the cells think there is less T4 and thus increase TSH output and stimulates the thyroid. Removal of nicotine would have the reverse effect. From a 1999 article (5):
‚Äù In conclusion, nicotine increases D2 activity probably via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and may influence brain function, at least in part, by affecting thyroid hormone metabolism.‚Äù
As for what does actually lead to the weight gain we hear so much about after cessation of smoking, some very recent articles point to hypothalamic neural modulation (which is basically exactly what I had said in my previous comment). The hypothalamus controls the very basic functions of the body including temperature, hunger, satiety, sex drive, etc. There are 3 very recent articles (2011, 2011, 2012) that demonstrate nicotine having a modulatory effect on the hunger/satiety centers of the hypothalamus. In the first 2011 paper (6), we find that cells with nicotinic ACh act to modulate these centers . In another paper written just a few months later with the easy-to-roll-off-the-tongue title of ‚ÄúNicotine excites hypothalamic arcuate anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin neurons and orexigenic neuropeptide Y neurons: similarities and differences‚Äù (7) the authors demonstrate that even though both hunger and satiety are modulated by nicotinic ACh receptor neurons, there exists a difference in activation pathways that favor the satiety center activation. The last paper, in 2012 (8), found a specific biomolecular aspect in that nicotine also seems to inactivate a protein called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the hypothalamus. AMP is a molecule that tells the cell it is very low on energy thus an inactivation of the protein that responds to that would prevent the cell/body from responding to low energy states by increasing hunger.
‚ÄúOverall these data demonstrate that the effects of nicotine on energy balance involve specific modulation of the hypothalamic AMPK-BAT axis.‚Äù
So, in a nutshell:
There is little evidence to support any peripheral changes in thyroid hormone state from nicotine and more evidence to implicate thiocyanate as affecting thyroid function. However, these effects seem to be small and likely of little clinical significance except for a few articles I came across that seemed to implicate cigarrette smoking in worsening pre-existing thyroid conditions. 
The latest data seem to support the notion that upstream neuromodulatory effects of nicotine can and do affect hunger and satiety centers in the brain, which could be a larger contributor to weight gain/loss associated with nicotine. 
This is in addition to the behavioral aspects which I mentioned and Dr. Hall expounded upon. 
Hope that helps clear things up for you üòÄ

We have to do wrong to know what to do right, and in this rushed society things go bad quick. Society can take three routes, regression, maintenance, and progression. Society progresses regardless of whatever ignorant superstition holds it back, albeit slowly. The question to ask is, which one are you contributing to by promoting what you believe in? Regression, maintenance, or progression? Ultimately this ‚Äúorganic‚Äù, ‚Äúall-natural‚Äù fad, is just that, a marketing fad and phase for profit that will die out. The progress is toward completely synthetic food, that will be more nutritious than ‚Äúnatural‚Äù foods and have less impact on the environment. Enjoy the ride‚Ä¶

Here lies the problem. Claims made but just can‚Äôt seem to substantiate them and when people try to, it doesn‚Äôt quite turn out the way they planned. My hypothesis is that we eat in excess, don‚Äôt get off our asses, and made meat a main dish when it should be a side dish, BUT those are few of hundreds of different variables for why we have the issues. 
‚ÄúI only make claim to what has worked for me‚Ä¶actually, found others whom it worked for as well..and to tell anyone who wanted to try for themselves.‚Äù
I agree. I understand you are making statements from your views, ideologies, and experiences. I‚Äôm not going to insult you for that, or put words in your mouth as I see happening here. You have rights to your opinions, even if they contradict current evidence or objective reality. The general public needs simplicity, and you will finds others your methods worked with, as long as you take them step by step through it, whether it has actual physiological benefit or it‚Äôs placebo. I will generally let my athletes and patient try something (not me doing it of course, because I try to have more ethics than trying unfounded tx on them) if I know there is extremely minimal likelihood of harm. I give them as much information that I can about a particular treatment because I know they won‚Äôt get that info from the people giving the treatment, especially CAM. I butt heads with chiropractors constantly in my field. 
‚Äúwait, those same scientists that work for pharmas?‚Äù
Yes ANY study or trial done that disagrees with the ideologies held by people similar to yours is apparently all done and funded by ‚Äúbig pharma‚Äù. Yes, people that do those regulated studies under extreme scrutiny and put through peer review repeatedly are all greedy, malevolent basterds being bribed by the pharmaceutical companies. It‚Äôs all about making money right? Yes we are all jealous of Mercola and Oz because they thought of this stuff first, and figured out how to stuff their pockets full.

Society progresses regardless of whatever ignorant superstition holds it back, albeit slowly. The question to ask is, which one are you contributing to by promoting what you believe in? Regression, maintenance, or progression? Ultimately this &#8220;organic&#8221;, &#8220;all-natural&#8221; fad, is just that, a marketing fad and phase for profit that will die out. The progress is toward completely synthetic food, that will be more nutritious than &#8220;natural&#8221; foods and have less impact on the environment. Enjoy the ride&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;They in themselves are producing the obesity and other health problems in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here lies the problem. Claims made but just can&#8217;t seem to substantiate them and when people try to, it doesn&#8217;t quite turn out the way they planned. My hypothesis is that we eat in excess, don&#8217;t get off our asses, and made meat a main dish when it should be a side dish, BUT those are few of hundreds of different variables for why we have the issues. </p>
<p>&#8220;I only make claim to what has worked for me‚Ä¶actually, found others whom it worked for as well..and to tell anyone who wanted to try for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree. I understand you are making statements from your views, ideologies, and experiences. I&#8217;m not going to insult you for that, or put words in your mouth as I see happening here. You have rights to your opinions, even if they contradict current evidence or objective reality. The general public needs simplicity, and you will finds others your methods worked with, as long as you take them step by step through it, whether it has actual physiological benefit or it&#8217;s placebo. I will generally let my athletes and patient try something (not me doing it of course, because I try to have more ethics than trying unfounded tx on them) if I know there is extremely minimal likelihood of harm. I give them as much information that I can about a particular treatment because I know they won&#8217;t get that info from the people giving the treatment, especially <abbr title=""Complementary and Alternative Medicine"">CAM</abbr>. I butt heads with chiropractors constantly in my field. </p>
<p>&#8220;wait, those same scientists that work for pharmas?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes ANY study or trial done that disagrees with the ideologies held by people similar to yours is apparently all done and funded by &#8220;big pharma&#8221;. Yes, people that do those regulated studies under extreme scrutiny and put through peer review repeatedly are all greedy, malevolent basterds being bribed by the pharmaceutical companies. It&#8217;s all about making money right? Yes we are all jealous of Mercola and Oz because they thought of this stuff first, and figured out how to stuff their pockets full. Those damn pharmaceutical lab techs are rolling in the dough too. I got into the wrong business&#8230;.although if I was really looking to make money I&#8217;d get into making rehab equipment.</p>

I actually have not read or heard of that book. Shame ‚Äì it sounds quite good.
WRT to the concept of evolutionary diet, I think this is a reasonable and plausible avenue to explore. 99.99% of human evolution has occurred with a diet solely based on whole unprocessed foods. In such a short time (evolutionarily speaking) have humans adopted a diet high in processed foods, there is no way that the genome could possibly change this quickly to adapt to these massive changes in diet, evolution happens on a much longer time scale. 
First off I would be hesitant to say there is no way it possibly could. Indeed it could. Epigenetic factors can act quite rapidly without changes in population level allelic frequencies. Did it? I agree probably not
But the issue you bring up is more related to behavioral aspects of having access to inordinately calorie dense foods in unlimited quanities, not some aspect of physiological/phenotypical change as a factor of the genome‚Ä¶ which is what the paleo diet argument is based on ‚Äì that our physiology is best suited to those kinds of food. Not that our behavioral factors haven‚Äôt adapted to a new mode of eating. 
The other thing to consider is that just because evolutionary pressures have been stable for a very long time does not mean that it will take an equally long time to change once selective pressures change. 
The comments re: K and Na as well as microbiota are indeed interesting though. We may not be best suited for our environment ‚Äì the question is how do we address that? My contention is that looking at past states to try and infer best current states is not straighforward (like paleo diet believers and the TED talk would have you believe).

Point is, I think we&#8217;re eating too much and I don&#8217;t think we can point to synthetic compounds as a sole reason for issues. Sorry off topic slightly.</p>

So we‚Äôre on the same page, and in a nutshell, you‚Äôve shown smoking‚Äôs effect on thyroid metabolism are negative, probably mediated by cigarette smoke generally (goitrogens, etc.) and not nicotine. And smoking‚Äôs effect on weightloss is probably caused by deactivation of AMPK and/or effects on the hunger/satiety centers in the brain. Thanks!
Here‚Äôs why I was confused, I guess. As you say, (5) does show nicotine can have a downstream effect on astrocytes, causing them to convert t4 to t3, lowering intracellular t4 and thereby (probably) stimulating TSH by negative feedback. If that‚Äôs right maybe there‚Äôd be increased thyroid effects elsewhere‚Ä¶however this idea is not even remotely endorsed by the other studies. Maybe because this study was in vitro? Or maybe in ‚Äúreal life‚Äù because thiocyanate, etc. mask the effect (probably not since the other studies specifically showed nicotine has no effect)? But that was my confusion (now mostly dispelled by the large body of evidence you‚Äôve generated)
Also, wouldn‚Äôt a large increase in corticosterone lead to some lipolysis? It‚Äôs pure speculation (the ‚ÄúS‚Äù word‚Ä¶I guess in my biochem textbook it says corticosterone is not nearly as mighty as cortisol promoting lipolysis‚Ä¶and it‚Äôll be converted to aldosterone‚Ä¶that‚Äôs literally all i know) but what do you think? BTW at this point I point out you‚Äôve very clearly denied the original hypothesis‚Ä¶this new speculation is mostly out of interest and probably not clinically relevant.
I guess if you‚Äôre willing to post a multi-bulleted post you wouldn‚Äôt mind engaging in some more speculation üôÇ Thanks again for all the awesome comments. I‚Äôve put the original hypothesis to rest, despite these last few wonderings.

Yes, Dr. Hall has it right. We‚Äôve always had plenty of ideas about how to fix disease, derived from luck, anecdote, trial and error, and so on. What we didn‚Äôt have was a sound method for figuring out which were true and which weren‚Äôt. A rigorous methodical approach to building a case for or against a hypothesis, from basic pathophysiology up through clinical trials is why science-based medicine works better than opinion-based or faith-based medicine. It is the methodology designed to compensate for the limitations of human judgement that makes the differences, and clinical trials are a major element of that.

Nothing heroic at all. It actually seems to have taken me about the same amount of time to read the studies and write what I did as it took you to read what I wrote. This is purely because 1) med school and my background teaches you how to quickly parse this sort of data and 2) I did not dissect the methodology of the studies and took their conclusions at face value. #2 I think is reasonable based on the journals from whence they came and the topic of discussion (i.e. no CAM BS or wishy washy types of outcomes to worry too much about).
Glad you found it useful though.
As you say, (5) does show nicotine can have a downstream effect on astrocytes, causing them to convert t4 to t3, lowering intracellular t4 and thereby (probably) stimulating TSH by negative feedback. If that‚Äôs right maybe there‚Äôd be increased thyroid effects elsewhere‚Ä¶however this idea is not even remotely endorsed by the other studies. Maybe because this study was in vitro? 
The reason here is that the effects on conversion of T4 to T3 via D2 was mediated not directly from the nicotine but indirectly from nicotine‚Äôs stimulation of the nicotinic ACh receptors on the rat glial cells which then caused  downstream effect. Without those particular cells to react in that particular way there would have been no upregulation of D2 activity. That is why you don‚Äôt find the effect peripherally. Also, I would reckon that the overall contribution to thyroid hormone regulation via this pathway would be pretty minimal, though I can‚Äôt say for certain.
Also, wouldn‚Äôt a large increase in corticosterone lead to some lipolysis? It‚Äôs pure speculation (the ‚ÄúS‚Äù word‚Ä¶I guess in my biochem textbook it says corticosterone is not nearly as mighty as cortisol promoting lipolysis‚Ä¶and it‚Äôll be converted to aldosterone‚Ä¶that‚Äôs literally all i know) but what do you think?
Cortisol (and by extension corticosterone) typically acts to increase adiposity ‚Äì hence the buffalo hump and big bellies of Cushing‚Äôs patients. If you give people corticosteroids they tend to get fat, so I doubt that would be the mechanism you are looking for either. 
I am sure that all of these responses do ultimately play some role IRL. However, it seems to me that most of these are probably minimally clinically significant or useful. The major ones appear to be the behavioral aspect, the hypothalamic modulation aspect, and the goitrogen aspect of thiocyanate (in that order of significance decreasing from 1st to last, IMHO)
Anyways, hope that is satisfying enough. Happy to try at a few more if they come up depending on my mood and time availability üòÄ However, I wouldn‚Äôt call myself ‚Äúexpert‚Äù but perhaps more informed than average for sure.

I still think every person from the CEO down to the some sales manager that approved some lame kickback should be doing time. I don‚Äôt have time to look, but a Stryker sales rep was sent to prison for off-label push of some implant.
2) The Medicaid pricing fraud bothered me more than anything for some reason. With state budgets strapped to pay for medical care for our most at-risk citizens, the wealthiest crowd at GSK is doing its best to harm our weakest. There is just something offensive about that.
3) Big Pharma needs to fix the paradigm of the sales rep/physician model. I just don‚Äôt see how it can work any more, like it did 30 years ago. There are some areas where the sales rep is a required asset, especially in high ticket items. Also, in certain areas like cardiovascular devices.

They put the company at risk, because the rep is under pressure to make money by increasing prescriptions, so off-label use is highly lucrative.

@evilrobotxoxo NO. First Republican administration, it gets cut, and 10 years out, we have no drugs. You‚Äôre trying to destroy the pharmaceutical industry because of the stupidity and immorality of GSK.
","<p>1) I wish there were criminal penalties. I still think every person from the CEO down to the some sales manager that approved some lame kickback should be doing time. I don&#8217;t have time to look, but a Stryker sales rep was sent to prison for off-label push of some implant.</p>
<p>2) The Medicaid pricing fraud bothered me more than anything for some reason. With state budgets strapped to pay for medical care for our most at-risk citizens, the wealthiest crowd at GSK is doing its best to harm our weakest. There is just something offensive about that.</p>
<p>3) Big Pharma needs to fix the paradigm of the sales rep/physician model. I just don&#8217;t see how it can work any more, like it did 30 years ago. There are some areas where the sales rep is a required asset, especially in high ticket items. Also, in certain areas like cardiovascular devices. But in pharmaceuticals in primary care or hospitals, what&#8217;s the use?

First off this is a prime example of how CAM wants to have it any way it can. If there is no possible putative mechanism (reiki, homeopathy) then they cry out that there are plenty of drugs we use that actually work, but we don‚Äôt know the mechanism for so that should be analagous. If there is a potential mechanism then they love to try and make one up since they ‚Äì on some level ‚Äì realize that aping what actual scientists do is superficially better. 
In any event, I have some contributions to the actual content.
They speculated that the results were due mainly to the velvet bean component. Their rationale? Velvet bean seeds contain L-DOPA, L-DOPA has been shown to stimulate growth hormone (GH), and GH is ‚Äúclosely related to slow wave sleep.‚Äù Kind of convoluted, don‚Äôt you think?
Convoluted indeed. And the ‚Äúclose relationship‚Äù is that GH surges are predicated on sleep. In pretty much all data to date, the relationship shown and studied has been sleep‚Äôs effect on GH release, not GH on sleep. So already their proposed mechanism is on shaky ground.
However, there was a 2010 article in The Journal of Clinical Endrocinology and Metabolism (full text) that discusses this issue. They studied people with chronic growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and their sleep patterns. First off, they found poor sleep using the same questionnaire as this herbal supplement study. However, two interesting points. The first is that they found that those with primary pituitary GHD had an excess in intensity and duration of slow wave sleep (SWS) which lead to worse outcomes in sleep quality and quality of life. They also posit that it is the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) levels that is the primary driver of SWS and quality of sleep based upon the varied etiologies and sleep patterns of their GHD study group. 
The best part though (in relation to this article)? Part of the conclusion (emphasis mine) and to answer Dr. Hall‚Äôs question (If the supplement only works indirectly by raising GH levels, wouldn‚Äôt it be more efficient to administer GH itself? Would that work? ):
Nearly all GHD patients in our study received chronic replacement therapy (including hydrocortisone/cortisone acetate, l-thyroxine, and sex steroids) to correct associated pituitary hormonal deficits. Although an impact of hormonal deficits and their treatment on sleep quality cannot be excluded, the fact that younger and older patients were similarly treated and sleep was nonetheless more disturbed in older patients does not support a primary role of replacement therapy in the sleep disorders.
In other words, exogenous correction of known GHD did not improve sleep quality or QoL. So proposing an indirect mechanism of stimulating the production of GH as the putative mechanism for improved sleep quality (while still not out of the realm of possibility) is certainly contrary to the current general understanding and evidence regarding sleep and GH. 
Why didn‚Äôt they do a better study?
You mention spelling, grammar, and a list of obvious limitations to the study design. How about we tack on a terrible literature review as yet another facet of this bad study? This was published in June 2012. The article I cite above was March 2010. My rapid lit review turned it up instantly. How was it not part of their references cited page? They covered all sorts of other topics ‚Äì other studies on their herbal products, pharmacological studies on sleep (actually an inordinate amount considering their topic), general topics of sleep disorders and the impact on health, reviews of other CAMs and placebos on sleep, toxicity studies of similar herbal compounds, and plenty of studies on L-DOPA and its effect on pituitary hormone release.
A decent lit review should be a minimum for an article, especially when literature addressing a specific and explicit mechanism exists.

The purpose of this post is not to evaluate the entire ACA, only that small portion of it which may hold some hope for ridding the private health insurance system of CAM.  I think all of us who support science-based medicine can applaud that effort.

I too fear that the CAM lobbyists will try to gut these provisions but hope that they will be met by the considerable resources of the insurance industry, which is under more pressure than ever to keep premiums affordable.  The insurance industry has a great deal of self interest in ridding the system of state mandates and will push back against anything that reintroduces protected classes of coverage (like CAM) back into the system.

The first step in doing and understanding good science is realizing that there is something to understand. So good on ya!
I would recommend that you start by learning why bad science is bad. Ben Goldacre has a good book as a primer on that. Pick a topic that you find interesting or are otherwise passionate about and see if there is some bad science out there (climate change, evolution, CAM, whatever‚Ä¶ mine was evolution because I did my undergrad in it. Bad science in evolution also has the advantage of being really bad which makes it easier to get started. You can advance to Shapiro and adaptive evolution as that is much tougher to explain why it is bad [I have a few comments on it either here or at NeuroLogica) and then combat it. The internet is an endless source of people making bad claims to sharpen your teeth on. Practice, practice, practice.
Also start learning the common logical fallacies and cognitive biases people fall prey to. Understanding how and why the human mind is so fallible helps spot those mistakes and avoid them yourself. 
You can also try and think about how you might do a study differently and why. 
Some good books to consider:
Trick or Treatment by Simon Singh
Bad Science by Ben Goldacre
Snake Oil Science by R. Barker Baussell
The Drunkards Walk by Leonard Mlodinow
Made to Schtick by Chip Heath
I would also recommend going on YouTube and finding a user by the name of c0nc0rdance (spelled with zero‚Äôs not O‚Äôs) and check out his videos. He does a lot of them on scientific claims and does a literature review for the video and explains what it all means and why. He also covers logical fallacies and biases.
And lastly, a sometimes poster (but always welcome voice around these parts) by the ‚Äònym Prometheus has an excellent two-part post called Anatomy of a Study: A Dissection Guide (Part 1)

How do you know your experience is right?  Bloodletting was based on experience and was immensely popular for over two thousand years, but when we stopped doing it, people died less frequently.  
You‚Äôre also ignoring the experience of the scientists and doctors who do genuine research and think about these topics every single day.  You, who know nothing about medicine, drugs or research, are saying your experience is more important than people who study these things for years.  But your experience is limited ‚Äì you‚Äôve never had cancer, for instance, but you proclaim you can prevent and treat cancer (probably all cancers, despite there being hundreds of manifestations of improper cell growth).  You‚Äôve never had MS.  You‚Äôve never had COPD.  But still, you prescribe the same solution to all people ‚Äì avoid ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù, eat organic, take vitamins. 
When all you have is a hammer, you spend a lot of time breaking things.  
In the same way, it‚Äôs funny, but, there‚Äôs nothing you can say, prove, disprove..‚Äùscientifically‚Äù to me, if it‚Äôs against my own experience.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what stats you come up with, I know what I experienced. You can tell me all kinds of ‚Äòscience based ‚Äúfacts‚Äù and stats, why you tell me ‚Äòvitamins‚Äô don‚Äôt work, or it doesn‚Äôt matter organic or not, and the reason I know they‚Äôre not ‚Äúfacts‚Äù? , is because, I know already for myself what I‚Äôve experienced says otherwise..see?
That‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúscientifically‚Äù actually means.  It‚Äôs like an illiterate person trying to correct my use of punctuation.  
It‚Äôs a little more than ‚Äúwhat I believe‚Äù. It‚Äôs what I know.
The definition of ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù is ‚Äújustified true belief‚Äù.  Your beliefs have no justification, and they aren‚Äôt true.  All you have is faith in  your own experience, and experience in the absence of empirical testing has been shown repeatedly over thousands of years to be unreliable.  
I understand you or anyone else do not have to believe me, but the strange arguments, and attacks, personally, etc. in here, were not really expected. I thought you all were ‚Äòabove‚Äô this lol.
The arguments weren‚Äôt ‚Äústrange‚Äù, you just never understood them, never bothered to educate yourself, never bothered to understand where they came from or how they evolved.  Science and research is incredibly intricate but rather than trying to understand it, you just pretended it was dumb.  As for personal attacks, I get frustrated when I point out why a person is wrong and they do the equivalent of sticking their fingers in their ears and saying ‚Äúnuh-uh‚Äù.  Your arguments were literally child-like ‚Äì you didn‚Äôt understand the topic, you didn‚Äôt listen to reasoning, you just closed your eyes, plugged your ears and kept repeating yourself.  Why should I pretend this is a civil conversation of equals?
Ignorance is bliss, it‚Äôs great to be able to pretend that life is simple and controllable.  The next time you see a sewer worker, thank them because they‚Äôre the main reason you aren‚Äôt dead of an infectious disease.  Public health systems are the reason you get to pretend your vitamins are keeping you healthy.  Again I will point out that despite ‚Äúeating organic‚Äù, people living before 1900 died a lot younger, and in massive numbers compared to those in the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù modern world.

I applaud your efforts in sticking towards the science-based side of chiropractic. Certainly I think the education here in Australia seems much more evidence-orientated than what seems to come out of the US. While we do have a large number of quack-chiro‚Äôs here, they (in my experience) tend to be non-university educated practitioners, largely an older school if you will. 
I have a few friends currently doing a chiropractic course at an Australian university and, on the whole, my interrogations of them seem to indicate that it is largely evidence based, with a definite effort to weed out the quackery. What worries me however, is that the attempt to legitimise chiropractic by taking an evidence based approach is a half-hearted one. Subluxion and associated theory are thoroughly debunked, but ‚Äòdysfunction‚Äô tends to take it‚Äôs place as a descriptor for any issue that cannot be well-defined. My friends routinely offer ‚Äòadjustment‚Äô (I think terminology might be an issue here ‚Äì this ‚Äòadjustment‚Äô seems to be closer to what an American physiotherapist might term ‚Äòmanipulation‚Äô) for ailments other than MSK conditions associated with the back (persistent sinus pressure and an ankle sprain were the conditions in question ‚Äì ones which I am not aware of any evidence supporting such treatment). More concerning is the advent of ‚Äòchiropractic neurology‚Äô as a serious pursuit, without any real evidence behind it. 
So while I certainly approve of the attempts to bring real scientific rigour and practices into chriopractic, I think there is currently something lacking in the effort. While the Australian university-based courses certainly seem more scientific than their American counterparts, they do not totally abandon the treatment approaches of traditional chiropractic. I don‚Äôt know whether this is because of the presence of some more ‚Äòold-school‚Äô chiropractors as educators; or simply that if you strip out the bullshit, what you have left is essentially physiotherapy with an extra manipulation (or ‚Äòadjustment‚Äô) component.

I don&#8217;t know whether this is because of the presence of some more &#8216;old-school&#8217; chiropractors as educators; or simply that if you strip out the bullshit, what you have left is essentially physiotherapy with an extra manipulation (or &#8216;adjustment&#8217;) component.</p>

I for one would like to hear your thoughts. Back in the early 80‚Ä≤s when DRGs were first seeing broad implementation I gave some speeches to industry groups about the likely impact. At that time I used some news stories out of Toronto and the real life story of my Canadian father-in-law who died while waiting for his name to come up for a CABG under OHIP to illustrate that government control over health care did not always bring unalloyed good tidings. 
But nearly 30 years have passed since then and Canada spends substantially less per patient on health care than does the US ‚Äì and has excellent health care metrics. In fact Cuba, which spends less than $600 per capita on health care is in basically the same league in gross metrics as the US which spends on the order of $7500 per capita. Clearly, America has some things to learn.
My perspective (which is anecdotal) is informed by a couple things.  I‚Äôm young(ish), I eat a diet that probably goes beyond what any recommendations exist for intake of fruits and vegetables, I exercise regularly and my job has very good health insurance.  So I generally don‚Äôt have much need for a doctor and when I do I pay very little out of pocket.
That being said, I have experienced good and bad things about Canadian health care.  The good ‚Äì visits to the doctor have to date cost me nothing.  Walk-in clinics are pretty common, free with my health card and deal with minor complaints quite easily, requiring nothing more than time to wait.  My parents and grandparents have medical issues.  All have been able to see doctors about them, and have had several operations that cost nothing.  All have complained about some of the doctors they‚Äôve seen, but have been able to switch doctors without pentalty.  All the doctors and receptionists I‚Äôve had to deal with have been patient and polite, I never felt rushed or unwelcome.  Despite restrictions on ‚Äúone complaint per visit‚Äù my doctor has, in addition to my presenting complaint, answered questions and provided advice on unrelated minor issues without making any noise (and leaves my file open for me to read when he‚Äôs not in the room).  Even with insurance, the medications I‚Äôve needed to buy have been pretty cheap, I could have paid for them out of pocket with no trouble.  Pretty much everyone I‚Äôve known who has had to go to emergency care has experienced triage (so minor complaints wait a long-ass time) but actual emergencies are dealt with, for free, as emergencies and treated immediately.  I had a friend whose wife developed cancer and he had nothing but praise, effusive praise at that, for how well they were treated and the virtually seemless transition from service to service all the way from diagnosis to surgery to post-op chemo.  His one complaint was the lengthy, horribly stressful gap between a biopsy and a diagnosis of cancer, but after that diagnosis, treatment was fast and as easy as can be expected.
The bad ‚Äì finding a doctor is reputedly difficult (I found one rather easily, but my ever-wise spouse suggested he was willing to take me on because I was young(ish) and in good health) but there has been much bragging at the provincial level about efforts to increase the number of family doctors.  Getting an appointment with your regular doctor can be an issue, waiting up to a month for an appointment.  I had to see a specialist (is a general surgeon a specialist?  A non-GP anyway) recently and that took three months for the initial appointment (but because of a cancelation the actual procedure was within a week).  Some doctors are dicks, but that‚Äôs universal.  Talking to friends and family, seeing specialists is the bottleneck ‚Äì long waits before appointments and follow-up care.  Pathologists are apparently in short supply.  Every so often I‚Äôll read a news story discussing public coverage for CAM (or more recently the MS liberation procedure debacle) but fortunately the provincial government canceled coverage for chiropractors and the like a couple years back (I was seeing a chiropractor at the time and was a student, my cost per visit went from $10 to $14 I believe).
All of this is mostly invisible in terms of cost.  I pay taxes, health care comes out of taxes, but no user fees (or at least so minor I don‚Äôt notice them).  I routinely ask after appointments ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it?‚Äù and the only reason I pull out my wallet is to put my health card back in.  Health care is politically a pretty big deal, lots of time spent discussing cost, access, if our system is failing or not, private versus public versus mixed systems.  There‚Äôs lots of grousing but overall, I at least am quite satisfied.  I can‚Äôt claim to be anything close to even an informed consumer, but Joseph Heath makes arguments for universal health care in Filthy Lucre that I found convincing (primarily that universal coverage costs a lot overall, but per-capita is much cheaper than private insurance).  
So, overall, I‚Äôm a huge fan of universal health care.  It‚Äôs not without problems, and I am in a very lucky position, but I‚Äôm quite grateful that if I break a limb or develop a bunion, treatment is available essentially for free.

<blockquote><p>I for one would like to hear your thoughts. Back in the early 80‚Ä≤s when DRGs were first seeing broad implementation I gave some speeches to industry groups about the likely impact. At that time I used some news stories out of Toronto and the real life story of my Canadian father-in-law who died while waiting for his name to come up for a CABG under OHIP to illustrate that government control over health care did not always bring unalloyed good tidings. </p>
<p>But nearly 30 years have passed since then and Canada spends substantially less per patient on health care than does the US ‚Äì and has excellent health care metrics. In fact Cuba, which spends less than $600 per capita on health care is in basically the same league in gross metrics as the US which spends on the order of $7500 per capita. Clearly, America has some things to learn.</p></blockquote>
<p>My perspective (which is anecdotal) is informed by a couple things.  I&#8217;m young(ish), I eat a diet that probably goes beyond what any recommendations exist for intake of fruits and vegetables, I exercise regularly and my job has very good health insurance.  So I generally don&#8217;t have much need for a doctor and when I do I pay very little out of pocket.</p>
<p>That being said, I have experienced good and bad things about Canadian health care.  The good &#8211; visits to the doctor have to date cost me nothing.  Walk-in clinics are pretty common, free with my health card and deal with minor complaints quite easily, requiring nothing more than time to wait.  My parents and grandparents have medical issues.  All have been able to see doctors about them, and have had several operations that cost nothing.  All have complained about some of the doctors they&#8217;ve seen, but have been able to switch doctors without pentalty.  All the doctors and receptionists I&#8217;ve had to deal with have been patient and polite, I never felt rushed or unwelcome.  Despite restrictions on &#8220;one complaint per visit&#8221; my doctor has, in addition to my presenting complaint, answered questions and provided advice on unrelated minor issues without making any noise (and leaves my file open for me to read when he&#8217;s not in the room).  Even with insurance, the medications I&#8217;ve needed to buy have been pretty cheap, I could have paid for them out of pocket with no trouble.  Pretty much everyone I&#8217;ve known who has had to go to emergency care has experienced triage (so minor complaints wait a long-ass time) but actual emergencies are dealt with, for free, as emergencies and treated immediately.  I had a friend whose wife developed cancer and he had nothing but praise, effusive praise at that, for how well they were treated and the virtually seemless transition from service to service all the way from diagnosis to surgery to post-op chemo.  His one complaint was the lengthy, horribly stressful gap between a biopsy and a diagnosis of cancer, but after that diagnosis, treatment was fast and as easy as can be expected.</p>
<p>The bad &#8211; finding a doctor is reputedly difficult (I found one rather easily, but my ever-wise spouse suggested he was willing to take me on <i>because</i> I was young(ish) and in good health) but there has been much bragging at the provincial level about efforts to increase the number of family doctors.  Getting an appointment with your regular doctor can be an issue, waiting up to a month for an appointment.  I had to see a specialist (is a general surgeon a specialist?  A non-GP anyway) recently and that took three months for the initial appointment (but because of a cancelation the actual procedure was within a week).  Some doctors are dicks, but that&#8217;s universal.  Talking to friends and family, seeing specialists is the bottleneck &#8211; long waits before appointments and follow-up care.  Pathologists are apparently in short supply.  Every so often I&#8217;ll read a news story discussing public coverage for <abbr title=""Complementary and Alternative Medicine"">CAM</abbr> (or more recently the MS liberation procedure debacle) but fortunately the provincial government canceled coverage for chiropractors and the like a couple years back (I was seeing a chiropractor at the time and was a student, my cost per visit went from $10 to $14 I believe).</p>
<p>All of this is mostly invisible in terms of cost.  I pay taxes, health care comes out of taxes, but no user fees (or at least so minor I don&#8217;t notice them).  I routinely ask after appointments &#8220;that&#8217;s it?&#8221; and the only reason I pull out my wallet is to put my health card back in.  Health care is politically a pretty big deal, lots of time spent discussing cost, access, if our system is failing or not, private versus public versus mixed systems.  There&#8217;s lots of grousing but overall, I at least am quite satisfied.  I can&#8217;t claim to be anything close to even an informed consumer, but Joseph Heath makes arguments for universal health care in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filthy_Lucre:_Economics_for_People_Who_Hate_Capitalism"" rel=""nofollow""><i>Filthy Lucre</i></a> that I found convincing (primarily that universal coverage costs a lot overall, but per-capita is much cheaper than private insurance).  </p>
<p>So, overall, I&#8217;m a huge fan of universal health care.  It&#8217;s not without problems, and I am in a very lucky position, but I&#8217;m quite grateful that if I break a limb or develop a bunion, treatment is available essentially for free.  I don&#8217;t understand the US preoccupation (and apparent pride though perhaps that&#8217;s just the vocal minority being vocal) with avoiding a health care system.  Yes, the US does have the best care in the world&#8230;for the wealthy.  I&#8217;m not wealthy, so I&#8217;m really, really happy that I pay for health care through taxes.

"344523","163","138795",,"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/obamacare-and-cam/",,"Prior to ACA, the decision about medicare/medicaid coverage for a procedure was based on recommendations of a scientific panel given to the office of the director of medicare (CMS). Scientific evidence has long been a factore in CMS decisions about coverage for a procedure. That is why we had the USPSTF prior to the ACA.  The ACA creates several more panels, and changes the name of the USPSTF.  Ostensibly, the new panels will operate without political oversight, and are free to make decisions about funding of coverage without exposure to political (voter) pressures.
I am not sure how much CAM medicare/medicaid currently covers.  Here is a website that you can check for a given state.    Feel free to correct me, but I don‚Äôt think there is very much coverage for CAM in CMS.  States are much more variable in how they approach CAM.
The gottcha in the ACA is how it changes hospital reimbursement, and makes patient satisfaction scores a significant determinant in hospital reimbursement.  Satisfaction is important, but trying to please every patient is not a good thing.  Obviously, you don‚Äôt want to please the drug addict seeking opiods for a headache, but your satisfaction scores will go down.  An SBMer won‚Äôt want to provide homeopathy to a patient asking for it, but the satisfaction scores will decrease.  An SBMer won‚Äôt want to provide antibiotics for a minor non strep sore throat, but the satisfaction scores will suffer.
So what will the net effect of the ACA on CAM be?  Will the scientific panels really be free to make decisions based on evidence free from political pressure?  The scientific panels previously reporting to the CMS were largely free of political pressure.  Will the financial incentives to keep the patient happy mean give the patient what they want, instead of what the evidence says that they need?
Only time will tell.  But I doubt that medicare covered much CAM before the ACA.
In regards to the argument about retiring doctors, it‚Äôs all in how you spin the numbers.  If you look at doctors in private practice age 50 and over, I would suspect that 80% will retire within 10 years if ACA is not repealed or modified.  Either way, there will be a significant expansion of nurse practitioners and physician assistants because of the looming doctor shortage, and the delay in addressing the shortage.  A large percentage of US citizens won‚Äôt be able to keep their doctor.
In regards to the metrics used to compare healthcare systems, life expectancy reflects population habits as much as quality of care.  Recent increases in US Life expectancy can be attributed to the drop in smoking prevalence in the last 20 years.  It is predictable that because of the drop in smoking prevalence, the US life expectancy will continue to increase for the near future.
 http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=13089
I am sure someone in the future will claim the improvement in life expectancy is due to the ACA.
Doctors aged 50 and over were trained in a system in which nearly all teaching hospitals were ‚Äúsafety net hospitals‚Äù.  In return for receiving state and federal aid for training doctors, the hospital had a charter to treat patients regardless of their ability to pay.  We have all seen the triumphs, failures, and abuses of the system.  It is clear to any physician with that experience that universal health insurance does not equal universal healthcare.  The public perception that if you were uninsured and poor you wouldn‚Äôt receive healthcare was overblown.  I am sure that any physician in the 50+ age group, or any hospital administrator could give an example of an uninsured poor patient who received over $500000 in top quality healthcare.  
The public discussion leading up to the passage of the ACA really ignored the amount of care currently delivered for uninsured patients.  Why not expand the training of physicians and expand the safety net that still exists?  
One advantage of our broken system is that it provided healthcare options for poor unisured patients that weren‚Äôt available in some of the universal health insurance countries.  An uninsured patient in any state in the US was more likely to have a life saving helicopter transport for trauma than a patient with universal healthcare in Canada in the province of Quebec (at least until recently).  An uninsured woman where I work will typically wait no more than 4 weeks between an abnormal mammogram and the institution of treatment, thanks to charitable organizations (qualifying for medicaid usually takes longer, but that wait is a political decision).  I‚Äôve heard stories of women waiting 3 months just for the biopsy (or sometimes, just the further imaging) in other countries with ‚Äúmore compassionate‚Äù health care systems.  There are far more patients in the US over the age of 80 receiving cancer surgery, pacemakers, automatic defribillators, and renal dialysis.
That is not to say that our health system is the best, the best health system is that which meets the expectations of its populace.  I am just arguing that the choice of metric really reflects agendas of those writing the report.  We are dealing with diverse, complex systems.
The US health system needs reform.  The ACA really only addresses health insurance reform.  Universal health insurance does not equal universal health care.  If doctors are going to address the health needs of the aging population in the US, we need something different‚Ä¶ efficiency (more time spent actually delivering the care, rather than more time recording it for policy wonks in the beltway who want to look over our shoulders), and more doctors.

Thanks for your thoughts on the Canadian model.  Perhaps much has changed.  
For what little it is worth, I see some real benefits to universal care, at least universal first tier care.  As you may or may not know, we don‚Äôt have uninsured people dying like flies here from appendicitis and broken bones.  The care gets delivered but in the least efficient manner possible.  Hospitals then jack up rates for everyone else to cover that care.  Having universal coverage would regularize that health care delivery and remove a good deal of fear and uncertainty from the lives of people not fortunate enough to have quality health insurance.  And it forces everyone with an income to contribute (though this might seem a negative to young and healthy people who would rather use that money to buy a home or start a family).
But the US government has a poor track record managing large entitlement programs; it is so very easy to give now and worry about paying for it later.  The classic programs of Social Security and Medicare are good examples.  SS started as a safety net for widows and orphans and has grown to become a program that touches the lives of all Americans.  Legislators have known for decades that the demographic feces were going to hit the fan but have simply kicked the can down the road hoping, on supposes, that the problem would become a crisis until they were retired from office.  No one argues that Social Security as a basic concept is a bad thing.  But rational people have good reason to question the breadth of the program and its financing; essentially its management by our elected leaders.
Which brings us back to health care.  The immediate problem is not the 30 million uninsured; that is more a symptom than a cause.  The problem is providing quality basic health care to a nation of 350 million without spending twice what other nations spend on a per capita basis.

Great comment.
‚ÄúThe public discussion leading up to the passage of the ACA‚Äù
There really wasn‚Äôt much public discussion leading up to passage.  There was lots of demagoging on both sides but little meaningful discussion. 
‚ÄúWhy not expand the training of physicians and expand the safety net that still exists? ‚Äù
That physician supply wasn‚Äôt addressed (or even considered so far as I can tell) borders on incredible.  But the safety net that currently exists relies on a terribly inefficient delivery system.  As you point out there is already de facto universal coverage; we do not have people dying in the streets of appendicitis.  But routine care is less available and critical care can leave the uninsured or under-insured bankrupt.  My strong libertarian impulses would normally label financial ruin a fitting consequence for not carrying insurance.  But the cost of health insurance is astronomical and flatly unaffordable for some.
Health care is a limited resource.  The issues are: how are we going to allocate this resource and how can we expand the resource to make it less scarce?  All of this without breaking the budget.
PPACA doesn‚Äôt really address either of these.

Thanks for your thoughts on the Canadian model. Perhaps much has changed.
Probably the last 15 years or so there has been a lot of noise made about the Canadian health care system.  For some reason it‚Äôs seen as a point of national pride (because no other country has a health care system?  I dunno why).  I haven‚Äôt been following it with anything like attention, but I‚Äôve noted headlines talking about reduced wait times, increased funding, things like that.  Definite effort has been made and money spent on improving things, though I can‚Äôt personally say I‚Äôve noticed a difference (again, health, good insurance, minimal contact so I‚Äôm more likely to think things are great).
In a lot of ways, Canadian identity is defined in opposition to American.  Since you don‚Äôt have a health care system, we‚Äôre extra proud of ours.  Our beer is better than yours (no idea, I don‚Äôt drink beer).  We‚Äôre self-effacing, you‚Äôre loud.  Nonsense stereotypes like that.  As a Canadian who tries to be cold-blooded about things, I‚Äôd rather we compared ourselves to Northern Europe.  
Immigration does seem to be less of a bugbear here than Scandinavia though, probably because we lack a coherent identity other than ‚Äúclean and bland‚Äù.  There‚Äôs a pretty good joke ‚Äì what‚Äôs the difference between Canada and yogurt?  Yogurt has culture.  AHHAHAHAHA!  Put that in your touque and smoke it!
I‚Äôve said it before, but I‚Äôll repeat it ‚Äì I think a universal health care system is a fantastic thing.  I think the vocal and somehow moral opposition to it in the US is hystrionic and bizarre.  If PPACA becomes a reality, I bet 20 years from now you‚Äôll wonder what you were fussing about.

Also, you commented about the relationship between innovation and total health care costs, but medical research is funded through mechanisms that are largely disconnected from the provision of routine clinical care.  Also, the actual number of dollars spent on research is a tiny, tiny fraction of health care-related spending.
@Marcus Welby: I think most people agree that a single-payer system would be more efficient, and as a physician (who does mostly research), that would be my personal preference.  However, it‚Äôs not entirely clear how PPACA will affect costs, and although I agree it doesn‚Äôt include anything that‚Äôs proven to lower costs, it‚Äôs plausible that simply extending coverage is enough to lower them.  That‚Äôs counterintuitive, but the basic idea is that the vast majority of health care dollars are spent in hospitals, not the outpatient setting.  The US has de facto universal coverage at the inpatient level because hospitals can‚Äôt turn away people who are sick enough to require hospitalization.  But we don‚Äôt have universal coverage at the primary care level to keep people out of hospitals.  I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any evidence that extending primary care coverage will help prevent hospital admissions, but there have been studies showing that excess admissions are the single largest factor driving increased health care costs in segments of the US vs. demographically-matched segments of other countries.

","<p>@windriven: they tried to go with single-payer (e.g. &#8220;the public option&#8221;), but I think they had to cut it out because a few of the conservative Democrats wouldn&#8217;t go for it.  Also, you commented about the relationship between innovation and total health care costs, but medical research is funded through mechanisms that are largely disconnected from the provision of routine clinical care.  Also, the actual number of dollars spent on research is a tiny, tiny fraction of health care-related spending.</p>
<p>@Marcus Welby: I think most people agree that a single-payer system would be more efficient, and as a physician (who does mostly research), that would be my personal preference.  However, it&#8217;s not entirely clear how PPACA will affect costs, and although I agree it doesn&#8217;t include anything that&#8217;s proven to lower costs, it&#8217;s plausible that simply extending coverage is enough to lower them.

Moreover, according to a recent Cochrane review, the scientific evidence that flu shots protect the elderly is weak. The authors concluded that: 
‚ÄúThe available evidence is of poor quality and provides no guidance regarding the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of influenza vaccines for people aged 65 years or older.‚Äù
Cochrane reviewers also evaluated whether or not flu shots given to health care workers can help protect the elderly patients in nursing homes with whom they work. The research did not find an effect from the vaccinations on laboratory-confirmed influenza.  Influenza vaccinations were also not linked to a reduction in either pneumonia or deaths from pneumonia. In conclusion, the authors state that: 
‚Äú[T]here is no evidence that vaccinating health care workers prevents influenza in elderly residents in long-term care facilities.
Ditto for children. A large-scale, systematic review of 51 studies, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviewsin 2006, found no evidence that the flu vaccine is any more effective than a placebo in preventing influenza in children under two. The studies involved 260,000 children, age 6 to 23 months.
Two years, later, in 2008, another Cochrane review again concluded that ‚Äúlittle evidence is available‚Äù that the flu vaccine is effective in preventing influenza in children under the age of two.
As for the general adult population, Cochrane published the following bombshell conclusion last year: 
‚ÄúInfluenza vaccines have a modest effect in reducing influenza symptoms and working days lost. There is no evidence that they affect complications, such as pneumonia, or transmission.
WARNING: This review includes 15 out of 36 trials funded by industry (four had no funding declaration). An earlier systematic review of 274 influenza vaccine studies published up to 2007 found industry funded studies were published in more prestigious journals and cited more than other studies independently from methodological quality and size. Studies funded from public sources were significantly less likely to report conclusions favorable to the vaccines.
The review demonstrated that reliable scientific evidence confirming that influenza vaccines are effective is thin and there is plenty of reason to suspect that there may be a manipulation of conclusions when the studies are funded by drug companies. The content and conclusions of this review should be interpreted in light of this finding.‚Äù

To quote from the top of this page:
‚Äúa discovery considered fundamentally important to the point that it changes the way we think‚Äù
-So this one common feature lessens the surprise that some originators of beliefs and ideas will earn both labels.
One might even say that a ‚ÄúNobel laureate‚Äù is just a different-thinker after they have succeeded in talking enough (sufficiently powerful) others round to their invented new way of thinking. Thus there are three possible progressions, given that you think in a changed way:
unnoticed different-thinker -> crank -> Nobel Lauriate
unnoticed different-thinker -> crank
or merely
unnoticed different-thinker.
On this argument, having already been a crank once, it is hardly surprising that some Nobel laureates exhibit characteristics that will cause them to achieve the same label a second time.
Only a week before I write these words, we saw another (rather long) instance of what might, quite likely, turn out to be this same progression:
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/large-hadron-collider/9376804/Higgs-boson-Prof-Stephen-Hawking-loses-100-bet.html
http://www.nationalpost.com/From+ridicule+rave+Higgs+boson/6885691/story.html
A few things I‚Äôd be interested to know (but probably never will):
-roughly what proportion of Nobel Laureates are later held to be sufferers of Nobel disease?
-is that proportion higher in medicine than in other sciences?
-what proportion of Nobel Laureates either actually were (when they first communicated it) or would have been (had they communicated it, assuming they instead kept it quiet for a while) described by respected figures as a ‚Äúcrank‚Äù (or in similar terms) at the time they initially formulated the very way of thinking that subsequently has in fact earn them the Nobel prize.
-how many people who never shook off the ‚Äúcrank‚Äù label were in fact essentially correct in their ‚Äúcranky‚Äù idea, but we just don‚Äôt know it yet?
Some thoughts (from a scientist without medical qualifications) about the specifics mentioned in comments above:
I often find the reasons given by respected medical scientists why an idea ‚Äúobviously cannot be true‚Äù completely unconvincing from a lay perspective. E.g. above:
‚Äúthere is no disease of infectious origin where long term antibiotic treatment is a useful treatment modality. Such a treatment modality would have low prior plausibility. If the bacteria is susceptible to the antibiotic, then the antibiotic will kill it and the immune system would clear the rest.‚Äù
How do we know that this bacterial killing process, cannot for any infection, take a long time to complete? In other words, how do we know that there is not one single infectious pathogenic organism in existence for which antibiotics could suppress its reproductive rate in human patients only just sufficiently to tip the balance and eradicate it gradually? I get the impression from the above that ‚Äì due to the ‚Äúcollateral health damage‚Äù (which I do not dispute for a second) of antibiotics, it is  in any case considered unethical to even try the experiment. So in that case, one would not know if it would have worked, and surely then we simply do not now know (either whether there is, or there is not some ‚Äúdisease of infectious origin where ‚Ä¶.‚Äù). Is not knowing forbidden in medicine?
When it comes to medicine, my scepticism about medical experts‚Äô utterances is all the greater for two other reasons:
I‚Äôve heard it all before: where it turned out later to be wrong. I am old enough to have known people with illnesses who were told XYZ cannot be a disease mechanism because dumdedumdeda, only to discover decades later that XYZ in fact was a disease mechanism. (The problem is that we all ‚Äì including lay persons ‚Äì know some historical examples: One of my friends at college suffered for years with stomach ulcers and was told ‚Äúwe know the stomach is too acid for bacteria to be the cause of a stomach ulcer, so we can dismiss that idea, etc‚Äù.)
The whole tenor of this article, and many of the comments from medical experts, reads to me as though we all know that it is easy for us in the mainstream to decide for sure the difference between fakery and quackery on the one hand and, on the other, new ideas whose time has not yet come. But can you really look at the history of medicine up to 2012 and say that?
I know that biology, the human body, medicine is incredibly complex. We all know that. Is medical science not in fact in its early infancy for that reason alone?
","<p>&#8220;Nobel laureate&#8221; and &#8220;crank&#8221; have in common that they both are labels assigned to an individual specifically for the act of thinking differently (from those assigning the label). To quote from the top of this page:</p>
<p>&#8220;a discovery considered fundamentally important to the point that it changes the way we think&#8221;</p>
<p>-So this one common feature lessens the surprise that some originators of beliefs and ideas will earn both labels.</p>
<p>One might even say that a &#8220;Nobel laureate&#8221; is just a different-thinker after they have succeeded in talking enough (sufficiently powerful) others round to their invented new way of thinking. Thus there are three possible progressions, given that you think in a changed way:</p>
<p>unnoticed different-thinker -&gt; crank -&gt; Nobel Lauriate</p>
<p>unnoticed different-thinker -&gt; crank</p>
<p>or merely</p>
<p>unnoticed different-thinker.</p>

I know, and greatly respect, the Cochrane group.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean they are always right, and it doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt interpret and report the data without any bias.  Again I urge you to look at the linked sciencebasedmedicine posts, or search for articles discussing the Cochrane‚Äôs influenza group.  According to Drs. Crislip and Gorski (possibly others, my apologies if I don‚Äôt remember all those who discussed it) the influenza section puts a definite opinionated stamp on the influenza vaccine; despite equivocal data, they seem to really like summarizing it like the data is negative.  So please read the SBM posts, you might learn something.
Question though, since apparently you respect the Cochrane group that you‚Äôre willing to take them at their word unquestionably, I wonder what you think of their reviews of herbal preparations, which pretty much conclude as a unit that no good trials have been done on herbs proclaimed to be effective?  
Regarding the graph you provide, did they do an analysis of the benefits of those drugs?  For instance, is there a second graph that details deaths due to untreated medical conditions?  Because in my experience, my doctor has never given me a drug without there being a good reason, and therefore just looking at deaths and adverse events without looking at benefits (in particular saved lives) is either gross oversight or pretty much blatant lying to support a pre-held conviction.  For instance, another interpretation of that graph is that not many people die in general.  Did you also note the conclusion at the top, ‚ÄúMedical injury poses a greater risk to society simply because vastly more citizens are exposed to that risk and hence die‚Äù?  In other words the denominator is quite large, thus you can‚Äôt really say ‚Äúmedicines are risky‚Äù as a flat statement.
Lesley Braun‚Äôs / Marc Cohen‚Äôs evidence based guides on Herbs & Natural Supplements, Churchill Livingstone / Elsevier or the online database: http://www.greenmedinfo.com/
Since you are aware of the esteem with which the Cochrane review is held, rather than that website may I suggest you present us with individual Cochrane reviews?  Or perhaps pubmed links?  Both for specific herbs, since a random website isn‚Äôt much help.  Also, we already know about St. John‚Äôs wort and it‚Äôs adverse effects.  
If the very premise on which vaccination supposedly works has now been debunked as untrue (see my post above), why do you still keep advocating vaccination?
Well, first of all that‚Äôs a single study.  Has it been replicated?  Second, are you sure it says, or even implies, that that finding in mice completely invalidates the effectiveness of vaccination in humans.  Third, have you had smallpox or polio lately?  Even if that study is correct, all it implies is that our knowledge of the mechanism is perhaps flawed ‚Äì but vaccines still demonstrate in real-world settings considerable effectiveness.  So even if the study suggests the mechanism is wrong, that means we just need to learn the actual mechanism, not that vaccines don‚Äôt work.

Thanks for the correction.  The discussion that I had heard was that the final bill was amended to lengthen coverage for the safety net system, the community health centers.  I was under the impression that the politicians didn‚Äôt think funding of the safety net system was still necessary, because they were going to provide insurance for all.
In the safety net hospitals I worked in, uninsured poor patients would eventually be signed up for medicaid.  However, because of bureaucracy, it would often take several months for them to be accepted into medicaid.  Medicaid would never pay for medical care delivered before they were accepted.  Because of the delay in coverage, the safety net system was very important in providing care.
In the lay press, Medicaid is included in the safety net system.  It is part of the safety net system, but has the issues of delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement so low most facilities lose money taking care of medicaid patients.  Here is a recent lay press article that mentions what I call a safety net hospital (Jackson).
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/health/policy/in-florida-a-fight-brews-over-governors-vow-to-opt-out-of-medicaid-expansion.html?pagewanted=2&ref=health
In that article there is a statement that the poor uninsured patients might have to wait more than a year for advanced testing.  That wait has been described in recent years for the patients receiving universal coverage in other countries.  Part of my argument is that the efforts of our healthcare community serving poor uninsured patients has been misrepresented in the rhetoric surrounding the ACA.  They have to endure greater waits than insured patients, but so do insured patients in countries with more cost controls on healthcare.
I also think there were many good initiatives prior to the ACA attempting to reduce and control costs.  One of the better that I had read about (but never worked in) was the Oregon state initiative.  They used an evidence based approach to rank procedures for cost effectiveness.  Politicians would then vote on the amount of funding for medicaid, aware of how far down the list they were providing funding for.  CAM wasn‚Äôt funded by that mechanism.  Voters could then remove politicians from office for either raising taxes too much, or funding healthcare too little.  But the national politicians have divested themselves from such responsibility (which may be a good thing on the national level).  However, I never had personal experience working in Oregon, so I don‚Äôt know how that initiative worked out.
In my office (I was just one of several  partners), we had less administrative overhead working with the uninsured safety net patients (or for that matter the uninsured patients) because we had a negotiated price, and patients arrived with a voucher for payment.  No complicated registration process, no complicated computerized submission of bills to medicaid including all of the information they wanted to receive (but never appeared to have used).
In the county I working in, one of the orthopedists tried to set up a community clinic staffed by volunteer physicians (including specialists) to provide free care on a regular basis.  We were willing to support it (we supported other charity clinics with free or reduced rate exams).  However, I think malpractice concerns sank it (yes the state had good Samaritan protections, but various court rulings had weakened the protections).
Getting back on the subject of the posted article, mechanisms have existed prior to the ACA to limit funding to only science based medicine.  Whether or not the ACA strengthens those mechanisms remains a matter for subsequent observation.  Based on interpretation of the bill, it should strengthen SBM.  The unknown factor weight is how patient satisfaction role in reimbursement could weaken it.
Patients want unnecessary CAM, diagnostic procedures, and treatments.

Thank the FSM however, that they are still doing research and debating how to best implement their treatments.

Thanks for the correction.  Medicare coverage for chiropractic treatment may not be as restricted as I thought.  I did find this information supposedly from CMS, authored in Oct 2011 that implies that Medicare is still covering spinal manipulation for spinal subluxation.

There have been some scientific panel reports on CAM under the ACA.  Unfortunately, they exhibit the same weakness of EBM that lead to this Blog suggesting SBM could correct EBM‚Äôs weakness in ability to reach negative conclusions about CAM.
Here is a report listed on the ahrq (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of the American government, Department of health and human services)
‚Äù
More data from long term and large head to head trials with sufficient duration of CAM
treatments and trials comparing CAM treatment to other widely used active treatments (e.g.
comprehensive physiotherapy) reporting clinically relevant and validated outcomes (e.g. pain
intensity, disability, direct and indirect costs, utility of conventional care, and adverse events) are
needed for definitive conclusions.
Future studies should control for or examine the influence of treatment dose/duration, care
provider-(e.g. certification, years of experience) and population-specific variables on treatment
effect estimate.

Sounds like the Cochrane Collaboration!
I am afraid that in spite of the sound of the law, if EBM without SBM corrections rule the scientific panels, then CAM will continue to be funded, because EBM will only ask for more studies to be completed.  Of course, defunding CAM would be one of the ways to cut the cost of healthcare in this country without reducing quality, but I have yet to see progress on that issue.
The question I have asked before is; are they willing to cut back some services knowing the evidence will predict an increase in mortality, but then fail to cut back on treatments known to be ineffective?  If the government argues that we can‚Äôt afford to pay for a pacemaker to extend the life of an 85 y/o for an average of 3 months, and that we can provide universal health insurance because of such cutbacks in medicare, then they damn sure should not provide funding for CAM in that health insurance (or Viagra for sex offenders)!

I still appreciate the more reliable information than what I have presented.
From my perspective, I have seen the state and federal government dismantle the medical education system as the safety net for uninsured poor.  That approach provided an increase in the number of trained physicians, and much lower debt for the graduating physician, as well as high quality free medical care.  Then, after the government withdrew the support, the press lambastes the healthcare system for not providing care to poor uninsured patients. In fact, it still does, in spite of the withdrawal of government support.
So the government quietly withdraws support for the safety net, the health insurance industry loses money on the stock market and raises premiums, and now we have to completely revamp the healthcare system?  The system needs reform, I personally haven‚Äôt seen the US government increase the cost effectiveness of healthcare delivery.  If the government can‚Äôt reduce costs by increasing cost effectiveness, the only alternative for reducing costs is to reduce the quantity or quality of healthcare delivered.
I don‚Äôt share the optimism because I think our politicians are deceptive, journalists are either foolish or blinded by an agenda, and the public hasn‚Äôt been able to have a reasonable discourse (nobody knew what was in the bill when they voted on it)?  
In regards to wait times for procedures for uninsured poor patients in the US versus insured patients in other countries‚Ä¶ that is a study I would really welcome.  Occasionally a published study (either scientific or for public review) will mention the wait time.  Many public reports have the goal in significantly reducing waiting times, and I think there has been significant improvement.
Here is a reference from the NHS in the UK to the maximum allowed waiting time between referral to a specialist, and the beginning of care by the specialist ‚Äî 18 weeks.  That is not the average wait time, but apparently you can‚Äôt complain about the length of wait until that time has passed.
http://www.nhs.uk/choiceintheNHS/Rightsandpledges/Waitingtimes/Pages/Guide%20to%20waiting%20times.aspx
I don‚Äôt know for sure how that relates to the length of time between identification of a mammogram abnormality, and institution of breast cancer treatment. That is just a topic I have experience with.
Anecdotal information suggests in our community at least, an uninsured poor woman will receive a biopsy and definitive treatment prescription (timing of procedures may vary based on the nature of the tumor, nature of the planned surgery surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). in less than 8 weeks on average.  A public review in the province of Ontario, Canada showed a decrease in average wait times from 21 weeks to 20 weeks between 2001 and 2006.
https://www.cancercare.on.ca/cms/One.aspx?portalId=14473&pageId=14903
There are many other countries that report a shorter delay.
Either way, a real study of health care provided to uninsured patients would have resulted in better public discourse than the pathetic characterization that if you are uninsured, you can‚Äôt get healthcare in the US.  The press did report on a study of longevity, but the study had no adjustments for prevalence of smoking.  The sound bytes so often repeated in the media and in public comments was, ‚ÄúUninsured don‚Äôt have access to healthcare‚Äù, and, ‚ÄúThe US is the only developed country that does not provide healthcare for all of its citizens‚Äù.  Instead, the more accurate statement would be that 1. uninsured patients have to wait longer for appointments in charity clinics than insured patients with a primary care physician. 2. Uninsured patients tend to seek healthcare for non emergent problems in the ER.  This increases ER crowding.  More unnecessary tests are performed on these ER patients because the high liability facing ER physicians increases defensive medicine practices.  Charity clinics provide more cost effective care than the ER.

 An interesting thing about the graph, because you feel it might be correct, is why does it have a nice smooth curve, but at the end it gets a sharp ‚Äúturn?‚Äù 
This one‚Äôs easy. The graph was obviously made in Excel (there‚Äôs strike one right there), and the person who produced it simply fit an exponential growth curve to the existing data. I won‚Äôt even get into how contrived and improper it is to choose an exponential growth trend in this instance. Anywho, they hit a point where the extrapolated data for the next year would exceed 100%, so they clumsily cut it down to exactly 100%, thus the dropoff in slope for these final data points. 
A better approach would have been to pick out the x-coordinate where each trendline hits y=100, and stop plotting them there.
And the y-axis going up to 120 is just the default setting for Excel scatter plots. Whoever made this put about as much effort into making it look nice as they did into having it make sense. I‚Äôve made plots that look this terrible before, but never in a million years would I have considered publishing them.

‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, my two-year-old only eats hot dogs and Spagettios.‚Äù ‚Äù
I have to comment because my mom would try to get us to eat other things when we were kids but all we wanted were hot dogs. It should be noted we ate hot dogs a lot because we were poor and were denied food stamps (dad made $20 too much per month) but that‚Äôs another point entirely. When we could eat other food, we didn‚Äôt want it. At some point that changed, what age I cannot say cause I do not know but it could not have been too much after the age of 5 because schools don‚Äôt always serve hot dogs for lunch.
The point I‚Äôm making is that a food preference does not mean anything, if the kids at the play ground are kids of friends ask again what the kids like to eat in a year it will probably change. Another point of that quote, did you ask if they are offered anything else or do they demand hot dogs and Spagettio‚Äôs?

I think you should forward to comments on reading the bill to members of the US Senate and House of representatives.  I agree that you should not present yourself as an expert on the law when you have not read the entire law.  Certainly, a legisltor should not vote on a law they have not read. I wasn‚Äôt presenting myself as an expert on the law (and I welcomed corrections).  I was primarily discussing how the safety net system used to provide universal healthcare, a point that was lacking in the public discussion.
I apologize that my comments were so long that you misunderstood them.  You are arguing against me using the same major point I was making about the safety net system.  I said that government had decreased funding for safety net clinics/hospitals since previous levels.  That is why they are not as readily available.  I was advocating using the tax dollars headed for the ACA to be reinvested in the safety net system.  The safety net system had the significant benefit that more healthcare providers could be educated.  With more healthcare providers, people with insurance can find a provider rather than going to the ER.  In my experience that I discussed, the administrative overhead of medicare/medicaid was greater than safety net programs. I can say that because I have worked as a provider for the programs (in private practice and academic medicine).  Do you have experience contrary to mine? 
What happened in Massachusetts with universal health insurance?
‚ÄúBut, according to a report from the Division of Health Care Finance and Policy, expanded coverage may have contributed to the rise in emergency room visits, as newly insured residents entered the health care system and could not find a primary care doctor or get a last-minute appointment with their physician.‚Äù

What specifically did I say about the ACA that was incorrect in your reading of 2000 pages?  Frankly, I was mostly bemoaning the fact that the government was abandoning the safety net system, and the poor quality of the public discussion on the ACA.  One more comment from my experience before you answer.  You don‚Äôt really know how the law will effect the healthcare system until many directives are published in the federal register by the administrative branch, CMS publishes directives (another administrative branch), and some court decisions are made by the legislative branch.  I often find it amazing how certain verbage in the law is translated to regulation in the federal register or CMS directives.  Court decisions are more easily traced to the verbiage of the law, but tend to be slower in piling up.
The discussion pertinent to the lead article of the blog was whether the verbiage of the law would cut down on funding for CAM.  A reading of the law by an attorney suggests that it should result in reduced funding for CAM.  CMS directives that have been released after passage of the ACA, and published studies by one of the scientific government panels, suggests that it may not result in decreased funding of CAM.

<p>I think you should forward to comments on reading the bill to members of the US Senate and House of representatives.  I agree that you should not present yourself as an expert on the law when you have not read the entire law.  Certainly, a legisltor should not vote on a law they have not read. I wasn&#8217;t presenting myself as an expert on the law (and I welcomed corrections).  I was primarily discussing how the safety net system used to provide universal healthcare, a point that was lacking in the public discussion.</p>
<p>I apologize that my comments were so long that you misunderstood them.  You are arguing against me using the same major point I was making about the safety net system.  I said that government had decreased funding for safety net clinics/hospitals since previous levels.  That is why they are not as readily available.  I was advocating using the tax dollars headed for the ACA to be reinvested in the safety net system.  The safety net system had the significant benefit that more healthcare providers could be educated.  With more healthcare providers, people with insurance can find a provider rather than going to the ER.  In my experience that I discussed, the administrative overhead of medicare/medicaid was greater than safety net programs. I can say that because I have worked as a provider for the programs (in private practice and academic medicine).  Do you have experience contrary to mine? </p>
<p>What happened in Massachusetts with universal health insurance?<br />
&#8220;But, according to a report from the Division of Health Care Finance and Policy, expanded coverage may have contributed to the rise in emergency room visits, as newly insured residents entered the health care system and could not find a primary care doctor or get a last-minute appointment with their physician.&#8221;<br />

So far as I can see, we can at most point to some plausibility issues and some defects in the correlations.
Gee, Peter. If you don‚Äôt like my writing style and tendency to go into detail such that my posts occasionally top 5,000 words, then there‚Äôs a very simple solution: Don‚Äôt read them. Seriously. Problem solved. Save yourself the pain, boredom, and irritation that you loudly proclaim here. I rather suspect, however, that something about my posts compels you to read them. Otherwise, you probably would not subject yourself to them time and time again on such a consistent basis and then complain about how strident, long-winded, and, apparently, uncaring I supposedly am.
Be that as it may, these ‚Äúpoints of logic‚Äù that you dismiss so blithely and self-righteously are neither obvious to the vast majority of readers nor irrelevant. It‚Äôs necessary to take a two-pronged approach, to point out that correlation does not necessarily equal causation and that the apparent correlation is probably an artifact of better diagnosis, more screening, and broadening of the diagnostic criteria. I mean, seriously. There IS a major APPARENT increase in autism prevalence that occurred over the last 20 years. That is undeniable, and it is this ‚Äúautism epidemic‚Äù that antivaccinationists harp on to produce the appearance of a correlation. It is real in that the prevalence numbers are real. It is probably not real in that there are other explanations for the rise in apparent prevalence than a real increase in autism diagnoses. I have explained this time and time again, in many ways, in many posts, and in many places over several years. You know this. At the same time, it is also necessary to reiterate again and again that, even if this increase were real, correlation does not necessarily equal causation.
Finally, we do have a good way to exonerate vaccines: Multiple large, well-designed epidemiological studies comprising, taken together, many hundreds of thousand of children that fail to find a whiff of a hint of a wisp of a correlation between vaccination and autism prevalence or onset. As I reiterated in this post, the vaccine-autism hypothesis has been falsified about as well as anything can be falsified in medicine, so much so that we can use the shorthand of saying that vaccines do not cause autism.
Is that a simple enough message for you?
We should be able to run rings around intellectual lightweights like Whitaker. That is a poor basis for what looks very like smugness and complacency. The people for whom we need a clear, consistent, simple, obviously trustworthy message are mothers who are reluctant to subject their precious charges to even the potential for immediate risk. Remote, hypothetical risks and doctors‚Äô public health concerns will always take second place with them.
‚ÄúIntellectual lightweights‚Äù like Whitaker have outsized influence, far out of proportion to their lack of intellectual firepower. Think of ‚ÄúDr. Bob‚Äù Sears, Dr. Jay Gordon, and a whole host of other intellectual lightweights who promulgate antivaccine propaganda and keep the myth that vaccines cause autism alive. They use their MD degrees to bolster their credibility as they spew pseudoscience and quackery. It is not smugness and complacency to refute them. In fact, I would  argue exactly the opposite. It would be smugness and complacency if, knowing how vacuous their arguments are, we were to ignore them because they are such intellectual lightweights. Now that would be smugness and complacency! Ignoring them is not an option if you‚Äôre serious about countering their influence. Maybe in your ideal world it is, but here on the ground it really isn‚Äôt. Finally, we do have a clear, consistent, simple, trustworthy message. The problem is that, if there‚Äôs one thing intellectual lightweights like Whitaker are good at, it‚Äôs twisting and casting doubt on that message.
What do we say to them? Is there a clear message to be found anywhere? I suggest that the worst thing we can do is to appear to be in any way overly dismissive of their concerns and I think we can easily do that unwittingly, even by regarding the matter as scientifically completely closed, even while lacking the high levels of evidence that we usually demand in answer to other important medical questions (even Whitaker is aware of that). Mothers also know that we doctors would be pushing for vaccination even if at small risk to some individuals.
‚ÄúOverly dismissive of their concerns‚Äù? Jumpin‚Äô Jesus on a pogo stick! Have you been paying attention here the last four years? No one here‚Äîand I mean, no one‚Äîhas advocated dismissing parental concerns. We often go out of our way not to dismiss parental concerns. I myself have written about where those concerns come from, how they come from cognitive features of humans and how we think that are, basically, ‚Äúfeatures, not bugs‚Äù and how they don‚Äôt mean parents are stupid, a frequent straw man leveled at skeptics. Also, what do you mean by ‚Äúhigh level evidence‚Äù? Multiple huge epidemiological studies ARE high level evidence. Do you tell your patients that there‚Äôs doubt about whether smoking causes lung cancer because our primary data to indicate it are epidemiological studies and we don‚Äôt have any randomized, double-blinded studies demonstrating it?
Perhaps what you mean are the concerns of die-hard antivaccinationists. My response to that is simple: We do not cater to them, because their minds, with very, very few exceptions, are not changeable. In fact, they are the ones who promote antivaccine misinformation and pseudoscience. They are committed, and we are highly unlikely ever to convince them they are wrong. Fortunately, their numbers are small compared to our real targets: The fence-sitters, the parents who have heard the antivaccine propaganda or maybe have heard arguments like the ones used by Dr. Whitaker and do not have the mathematical or scientific background to recognize them as, well, B.S. They‚Äôre worried about vaccines because a bunch of doctors and parents spew superficially plausible-sounding pseudoscience that they don‚Äôt have the tools to recognize as pseudoscience. In Steve‚Äôs case in this venue, as far as we could tell from our observations (not having a before-and-after survey and all), this sort of strategy was wildly successful. Steve was calm, but he pulled no punches. At points using the word ‚Äúdeception‚Äù to describe the mortality vs. incidence bait and switch that Dr. Whitaker tried to use, and called the graph above ridiculous because, well, it is ridiculous. The audience, by all measures, ended up on Steve‚Äôs side.
That is how you do it, the way Steve did it. You don‚Äôt do it by handwringing and hedging. Steve did exactly what you say you want; he provided a simple message that demolished pretty much everything that Dr. Whitaker could throw at him.

I myself have written about where those concerns come from, how they come from cognitive features of humans and how we think that are, basically, &#8220;features, not bugs&#8221; and how they don&#8217;t mean parents are stupid, a frequent straw man leveled at skeptics. Also, what do you mean by &#8220;high level evidence&#8221;? Multiple huge epidemiological studies ARE high level evidence. Do you tell your patients that there&#8217;s doubt about whether smoking causes lung cancer because our primary data to indicate it are epidemiological studies and we don&#8217;t have any randomized, double-blinded studies demonstrating it?</p>
<p>Perhaps what you mean are the concerns of die-hard antivaccinationists. My response to that is simple: We do not cater to them, because their minds, with very, very few exceptions, are not changeable. In fact, they are the ones who promote antivaccine misinformation and pseudoscience. They are committed, and we are highly unlikely ever to convince them they are wrong. Fortunately, their numbers are small compared to our real targets: The fence-sitters, the parents who have heard the antivaccine propaganda or maybe have heard arguments like the ones used by Dr. Whitaker and do not have the mathematical or scientific background to recognize them as, well, B.S. They&#8217;re worried about vaccines because a bunch of doctors and parents spew superficially plausible-sounding pseudoscience that they don&#8217;t have the tools to recognize as pseudoscience. In Steve&#8217;s case in this venue, as far as we could tell from our observations (not having a before-and-after survey and all), this sort of strategy was wildly successful. Steve was calm, but he pulled no punches. At points using the word &#8220;deception&#8221; to describe the mortality vs. incidence bait and switch that Dr. Whitaker tried to use, and called the graph above ridiculous because, well, it is ridiculous. The audience, by all measures, ended up on Steve&#8217;s side.</p>
<p><strong><em>That</em></strong> is how you do it, the way Steve did it. You don&#8217;t do it by handwringing and hedging. Steve did exactly what you say you want; he provided a simple message that demolished pretty much everything that Dr. Whitaker could throw at him.</p>

 That is not the average wait time, but apparently you can‚Äôt complain about the length of wait until that time has passed.

I don‚Äôt know for sure how that relates to the length of time between identification of a mammogram abnormality, and institution of breast cancer treatment.[2] That is just a topic I have experience with.
Anecdotal information suggests in our community at least, an uninsured poor woman will receive a biopsy and definitive treatment prescription (timing of procedures may vary based on the nature of the tumor, nature of the planned surgery surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy). in less than 8 weeks[3] on average. 
[1] For non-urgent referrals such as fertility treatment, dermatology, orthopaedic problems etc.
[2]  It doesn‚Äôt relate at all, because, as is mentioned directly under the non-urgent referral guidelines, suspected cancer (among other serious issues) is dealt with under the TWR ‚Äì  two week rule.  Patients must see the relevant specialist and be sent for further investigations within two weeks.
That makes [3] null and void as an attempted criticism of UHC, because you deliberately misquoted referral guidelines for cancer.
My father‚Äôs GP was recently concerned about some respiratory symptoms he was having.  As dad is 78 the GP wanted to rule out lung cancer.  The referral was put in at 5pm on the Monday.  The consultant‚Äôs receptionist called at lunchtime on Tuesday with an appt. for the day after.  
By the time two weeks had passed he‚Äôd been diagnosed with COPD, started treatment, and had a follow-up with his GP, where the consultant was on speakerphone.
We live in a tiny, one-doc village.  The beauty of a centralised system means that we get the same care as people in urban and suburban areas.  The wheezing pensioner gets the same treatment as the city lawyer who‚Äôs coughing up blood.  
 The NHS want to spot potential cancers as early as possible, purely because stage 1 and 2 malignancies are cheaper to deal with.  People who disingenuously quote referral policies, to imply that potential cancer patients are sat around terrified for months before ever receiving treatment, in order to portray the ‚Äòhorrors‚Äô of socialised healthcare, are something I come up against over and over again.
Whether it‚Äôs: the hardcore libertarians with their ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alright, stuff everyone else, you‚Äôll take my taxes from my cold dead hands‚Äù mantra, the ‚ÄúWhy should I care if anyone else gets sick?     Can‚Äôt afford insurance?  Tough!‚Äù crowd, or those stupid enough to be campaigning against their own interests, the Medicare and Medicaid recipients who denounce socialised medicine as evil; one thing stands out time and again.  None of them have even a semblance of recognition of a social contract with their fellow citizens.  The last few years, of protesting against affordable care for all, have proven that.  Optimum health should be a right, especially in a wealthy, developed nation.

<p>We live in a tiny, one-doc village.  The beauty of a centralised system means that we get the same care as people in urban and suburban areas.  The wheezing pensioner gets the same treatment as the city lawyer who&#8217;s coughing up blood.  </p>
<p> The NHS want to spot potential cancers as early as possible, purely because stage 1 and 2 malignancies are cheaper to deal with.  People who disingenuously quote referral policies, to imply that potential cancer patients are sat around terrified for months before ever receiving treatment, in order to portray the &#8216;horrors&#8217; of socialised healthcare, are something I come up against over and over again.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s: the hardcore libertarians with their &#8220;I&#8217;m alright, stuff everyone else, you&#8217;ll take my taxes from my cold dead hands&#8221; mantra, the &#8220;Why should I care if anyone else gets sick?     Can&#8217;t afford insurance?  Tough!&#8221; crowd, or those stupid enough to be campaigning against their own interests, the Medicare and Medicaid recipients who denounce socialised medicine as evil; one thing stands out time and again.  None of them have even a semblance of recognition of a social contract with their fellow citizens.  The last few years, of protesting against affordable care for all, have proven that.  Optimum health should be a right, especially in a wealthy, developed nation.</p>

Thanks for quoting me correctly.
I specifically stated That I did not know wait times in the NHS for breast cancer treatment after identification of an abnormality on the screening mammography.  I then compared wait times in my experience working for uninsured patients to a published article for a province in Canada.  Our healthcare system has been compared to many other countries, not just the NHS.  
Now please note that in the preceding paragraph I stated that, ‚ÄúOccasionally a published study (either scientific or for public review) will mention the wait time. Many public reports have the goal in significantly reducing waiting times, and I think there has been significant improvement.‚Äù
Now this is a reference from the OECD discussing wait times observed in different countries.  It is a report from 2003, and wait times have changed since, but the discussion of the costs and factors of reducing waiting time is still relevant.  It does not report data on waits for breast cancer diagnosis/treatment.
http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/32/5162353.pdf
So the NHS has done well, which is one of the reasons I think it is better than the ACA.  The ACA is not recreating the NHS in the USA.
Advocating tax increases to support the safety net hospitals and clinics is not a libertarian stance.
You disingenuously quoted me the first time.  I specifically said I did not know how that NHS policy related to breast cancer diagnosis/treatment.  That was not disingenuous.

<p>Now please note that in the preceding paragraph I stated that, &#8220;Occasionally a published study (either scientific or for public review) will mention the wait time. Many public reports have the goal in significantly reducing waiting times, and I think there has been significant improvement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now this is a reference from the OECD discussing wait times observed in different countries.  It is a report from 2003, and wait times have changed since, but the discussion of the costs and factors of reducing waiting time is still relevant.  It does not report data on waits for breast cancer diagnosis/treatment.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/32/5162353.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/24/32/5162353.pdf</a></p>
<p>So the NHS has done well, which is one of the reasons I think it is better than the ACA.  The ACA is not recreating the NHS in the USA.</p>
<p>Advocating tax increases to support the safety net hospitals and clinics is not a libertarian stance.</p>
<p>You disingenuously quoted me the first time.  I specifically said I did not know how that NHS policy related to breast cancer diagnosis/treatment.  That was not disingenuous.</p>

The OP is correct in that you lose the weight by bring on a very very restricted diet, but misses the mechanism of action.  Taking HCG allows you to eat 500 calories a day without going crazy from hunger, you just aren‚Äôt hungry.

I‚Äôm not a neurologist P. Moran but I will state my opinion.  If a child has a high fever that triggers a febrile seizure the very nature of a febrile seizure does not predispose a child to autism or any other developmental disability:
http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/febrile_seizures/detail_febrile_seizures.htm
‚ÄúAre febrile seizures harmful?
Although they can be frightening to parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures are short and harmless. During a seizure, there is a small chance that the child may be injured by falling or may choke from food or saliva in the mouth. Using proper first aid for seizures can help avoid these hazards (see section entitled ‚ÄúWhat should be done for a child having a febrile seizure?‚Äù).
There is no evidence that short febrile seizures cause brain damage. Large studies have found that children with febrile seizures have normal school achievement and perform as well on intellectual tests as their siblings who don‚Äôt have seizures. Even when seizures are very long (more than 1 hour), most children recover completely, but a few might be at risk of subsequent seizures without fever (epilepsy).
In other words, between 95 and 98 percent of children who experience febrile seizures do not go on to develop epilepsy. However, although the absolute risk remains small, some groups of children‚Äìincluding those with cerebral palsy, delayed development, or other neurological abnormalities‚Äìhave an increased risk of developing epilepsy. The type of febrile seizure also matters; children who have prolonged febrile seizures (particularly lasting more than an hour) or seizures that affect only part of the body, or that recur within 24 hours, are at a somewhat higher risk. Among children who don‚Äôt have any of these risk factors, only one in 100 develops epilepsy after a febrile seizure.‚Äù

Such a connection might easily be overlooked and attributed to the the fact that many autistic children are prone to epilepsy, anyway.    I have looked for specific information on this point with little success which is why I asked if Dr novella had more direct information.

<p>Of course it is, but that was not what I was asking for reassurance about and I this was a brief afterthought when I realised I had failed to acknowledge your link.   </p>
<p>Without more detail as to the size and methodology of the studies referred to I cannot regard them as definitely excluding the provocation of autistic symptoms as an uncommon effect of febrile convulsions.    It would require a very much larger study to detect, say, a two-fold increase in rate of expression of autism than it would take to compare mental performance in cohorts with and without a history of febrile convlusions.</p>
<p>Such a connection might easily be overlooked and attributed to the the fact that many autistic children are prone to epilepsy, anyway.    I have looked for specific information on this point with little success which is why I asked if Dr novella had more direct information.</p>

‚ÄúYes. Divide and conquer. Its is substantially [easier] to get what a lobbyist wants on a state level then it is on a federal level.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt think you have spent much time working with politicians on either state or federal levels.  
Congress is powered by cash to a greater extent than are the various state legislatures.  That is not to say that lobbyists and the cash that gets them access aren‚Äôt ubiquitous on the state level, but it is the B team of lobbyists and B money as well.  The A team (or should it be K team?) is in Washington.  So are the A bucks.  And when you get your legislation it applies to the nation, not just to Rhode Island.
For an interest to pursue a national objective through the states it has to convince 50 state legislatures and 50 state senates; a daunting task.   When you think of this in terms of science based medicine versus quackery it should be clear that quackery has the upper hand.  Where are the lobbyists and cash machines pushing to eliminate quackery?  Who leads the SBM lobby in Kansas or Florida or Oregon?  But each of these states likely has associations of chiropractors and acupuncturists and maybe even homeopaths who have a vested interests.  Even many mainstream medical centers (to say nothing of medical schools) have departments of quackery.
I share the frustrations of many of the bloggers and commenters here.  But it is one thing to be on the right side of an issue and quite another to be on the winning side.

Reality is complicated by the fact that no treatment is either ‚Äúeffective‚Äù or ‚Äúineffective,‚Äù there are degrees.

We also have to let this line of thinking inform our interpretation of results.  Think of our prior belief about the length of survival in an oncology trial.

In fact, his website on cancer quackery was a major inspiration to me back in my early days on misc.health.alternative, long before my first blog was ever even a gleam in my eye (or I even knew what a blog was, for that matter) and remains so today. Indeed, I‚Äôve referred to his analysis of Gerson‚Äôs cases and continue to use his explanation of breast cancer testimonials (with attribution) in my talks today. Granted, I have expanded considerably on his explanation, but his explanation still serves as a sturdy basis upon which to build my discussion of primary versus adjuvant therapy, etc., and how testimonials often confuse, either unintentionally through ignorance or willfully, adjuvant with primary therapy.
That makes it all the more puzzling that he seems all too willing‚Äîeager sometimes,‚Äî to give other forms of quackery a lot more of a pass. In particular, I am disturbed by his apparent lack of familiarity about the extensive evidence base regarding vaccine safety, which includes many large, well-designed epidemiological studies in multiple countries that have failed to find a correlation between vaccines and autism, such that the degree of uncertainty regarding the falsity of the claim that vaccines cause autism is about as low as any level of uncertainty in medicine can be. It‚Äôs not as though we at SBM haven‚Äôt explained this many times before and analyzed examples of some of these studies. In fact, we have a sampling of them here:

I realize this list is hopelessly out of date; we do need to update it. It is, however, a sampling, and not even a comprehensive one by any means. Perhaps I could ask Peter a question: What studies lead you to believe that there might be a link between vaccines and autism? Which specific studies make you uncertain?
Finally, I do find Peter‚Äôs comparison of me to Stephen Barrett rather interesting. Dr. Barrett has never been exactly shy about calling a quack a quack, an antivaxer an antivaxer, and a charlatan a charlatan using language almost as ‚Äústrident‚Äù as mine. (Even Steve Novella sometimes approaches my level of ‚Äúinsolence.‚Äù He sure did at this debate.)

"344761","163","148527",,"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-plausibility-problem/",,"I find these calculations somewhat confusing. May I try to present a somewhat simpler calculation, that doesn‚Äôt need an online calculator?
As before 
power = TP/(TP+FN) 
it‚Äôs easier to not use to specificity (a tonguebreaker for me) but its complement the p-value:
p-value = FP/(FP+TN)
I abbreviate P = TP+FN the total number of items/persons that are in reality positive in the total population tested.
Similarly  N = FP+TN the total number of negatives
I‚Äôll come to the meaning of the ‚Äútotal population‚Äù later.
So we have
power = TP/P  ; p-value = FP/N
So the quotient of both is
power/p-value = (TP/FP)   /  (P/N)
rearranging terms
(TP/FP)  =  (P/N)  * (power/p-value) 
the three bracketed terms have their own name:
P/N = prior odds
TP/FP = posterior odds
power/p-value = Likelihood Ratio or RL.
So:
posterior odds = prior odds times likelihood ratio 
This is actually the Bayes formula in easier form. 
Example 1. power = 0.80   p-value = 0.05 , so the likelihood ratio is  0.80/0.05 = 80/5 = 16
If prior to the test the probability of ‚ÄòP‚Äô was 0.5, then the prior odds are 0.5/0.5 = 1
Hence the posterior odds equal 16 (ratio of positive to negative); if you want to convert the odds 16:1 into a probability, you get of course 16/17. 
Generally working with odds (ratio between probability of yes to probability of no) is easier in this context.
If the posterior odds are converted to probability you get the PPV. 
Example 2. (Imaginary homeopathy as in the text). The prior probability is 0.05, so the prior odds are 0.05/0.95 = 1/19. The posterior odds are (with the same power and p-value as before) evidenty 16/19, and expressed as a probability 16/(16+19) = 16/35 = 0.457‚Ä¶ (that‚Äôs the 0.46 of the text).
Example 3. (Real homeopathy) The prior probability that homeopathy is correct equals the probability that the total of chemistry and physics and pharmacology and biology and medicine of the last two centuries has a serious and large gap, hence is 10^-n where n is incalculably large. Now we do an experiment with p=10^-100 and a power somewhere between 0.001 and 1. The posterior odds are 10^-m, where m is only 100 or maybe only 97 less than the humungous number n. Evidently m is still humungous. 
Objection: these prior odds express of course that we consider it unthinkable that homeopathy works. However I cheated a little. As a staunch frequentist I don‚Äôt like to call anything a probability that cannot be somehow measured in practice or deduced from practical measurements consisting of repeating a chance experiment (throwing dice or coins for example). We evidently cannot rerun history 10 to the power humungous times and count how often a scientific development like our own one manages to leave an enormous gap. Or maybe we should rerun the whole history of the cosmos and see in how many universes homeopathy works for whatever life forms develop in them. So assigning prior odds to homeopathy is a kind of sleight of hand that I don‚Äôt really like.
Now what should we think when a homeopathy experiment comes out that strong (it happens!)? I conclude that the experimenter must have made a gross error or committed active fraud. That a homeopath does something wrong is far more likely than an accidental outcome like that from an impeccable experiment, and Hume‚Äôs principle of the least miracle applies. (That principle says that in case of a report of a miracle you must consider what is more probable: the miracle itself or the possibility that the reporter or witness is mistaken, or just is lying.)  
Now about testing medicines. We don‚Äôt know much about the prior odds. A reasonable guess might be obtained if we know how often that company has produced a comparable medicine that came to that stage and then finally was approved and not withdrawn later. But if the medicine is based on a totally new idea, then these odds may not apply.
Back to the ordinary testing of treatments. I simplify a bit further and I assume that the power is 0.50, i.e. a 50% chance that if the treatment really is somewhat useful the test will succeed. The likelihood ratio is 0.5/0.05 = 10.
So each independent test multiplies the prior odds by 10. Many such successful tests together multiply by as many factors 10. So even when the original prior odds were low, the final posterior odds would be very high, say 1000 (i.e. a 1000 to 1 odds that it works at least a bit).
I once read an utterly ridiculous book by Steven D. Unwin. He assigned to the existence of God prior odds of 1 (evidently he hadn‚Äôt been doing experiments to check that universes with and without God are roughly equally probable) and then he proceeded to convert various arguments pro and con into LRs equal to 1, 2, 1/2, 10 and 1/10. Multiplying all these numbers drawn from thin air (why 1/10 rather than 0 for the argument of unnecessary suffering?) he got posterior odds of 2 (all the time pretending that it was advanced mathematics with complicated formulas) and then claiming he had proved that the probability of God was 2/3. 
For me it was the ultimate proof that Bayes can lead to humbug.
","<p>I find these calculations somewhat confusing. May I try to present a somewhat simpler calculation, that doesn&#8217;t need an online calculator?</p>
<p>As before </p>
<p>power = TP/(TP+FN) </p>
<p>it&#8217;s easier to not use to specificity (a tonguebreaker for me) but its complement the p-value:</p>
<p>p-value = FP/(FP+TN)</p>
<p>I abbreviate P = TP+FN the total number of items/persons that are in reality positive in the total population tested.<br />
Similarly  N = FP+TN the total number of negatives</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll come to the meaning of the &#8220;total population&#8221; later.</p>
<p>So we have<br />
power = TP/P  ; p-value = FP/N</p>
<p>So the quotient of both is<br />
power/p-value = (TP/FP)   /  (P/N)</p>
<p>rearranging terms</p>
<p>(TP/FP)  =  (P/N)  * (power/p-value) </p>
<p>the three bracketed terms have their own name:<br />
P/N = prior odds<br />
TP/FP = posterior odds<br />
power/p-value = Likelihood Ratio or RL.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>posterior odds = prior odds times likelihood ratio </p>
<p>This is actually the Bayes formula in easier form. </p>
<p>Example 1. power = 0.80   p-value = 0.05 , so the likelihood ratio is  0.80/0.05 = 80/5 = 16<br />
If prior to the test the probability of &#8216;P&#8217; was 0.5, then the prior odds are 0.5/0.5 = 1<br />
Hence the posterior odds equal 16 (ratio of positive to negative); if you want to convert the odds 16:1 into a probability, you get of course 16/17. </p>
<p>Generally working with odds (ratio between probability of yes to probability of no) is easier in this context.<br />

But in many cases of crime there is all kinds of evidence of a probabilistic nature, for example faint traces of DNA or DNA that is degraded. In the first case the DNA may be the result of casual contact, in the second case the probability that it was someone else may not be one in zillion, but merely 1 in 500. If the defendant was picked from a database of millions of people on the basis of DNA found at the crime scene, then the ‚Äòone in a zillion‚Äô argument also weakens considerably. 
Also ‚Äòeye witnesses‚Äô may be mistaken. If the evidence used to convict a defendant were so absolutely sure that calculating the odds would not make much of a difference, then how come so many innocents are convicted of serious crimes? 
One of the reasons for false convictions is that some defendants have confessed, usually during a police interrogation. In the good old times of actual witch hunts a confession was all that was needed. And torture was also legal. But even nowadays there is a possibility of false confession. 
In fact probabilistic arguments play a big role in courts, I think, but in a very primitive form, namely where ‚Äòalmost sure‚Äô is taken to mean ‚Äòsure‚Äô, and where improbable (at least in the mind of the police, the presecution, the judge and the jurors) is equated to impossible, even though a prudent judgement would have to consider the ratio of two small probabilities.
Going back to the case of diseases. Suppose that someone who is not in any known risk group is tested for HIV, not because he or she has any reason to fear infection, but for example because a life insurance company asks a HIV-test. 
Now the person tests positive. What can we conclude? The answer is: not much. We are dealing with a very low prior probability (nobody knows how low, but maybe 1:10,000) and a very low rate of false positives (including administrative errors through mixing up samples or through contamination, maybe 1:10,000). The posterior odds are then basically the ratio of two unknown numbers that are only 0,0001 or less.

In particular, I am disturbed by his apparent lack of familiarity about the extensive evidence base regarding vaccine safety, which includes many large, well-designed epidemiological studies in multiple countries that have failed to find a correlation between vaccines and autism, such that the degree of uncertainty regarding the falsity of the claim that vaccines cause autism is about as low as any level of uncertainty in medicine can be. It‚Äôs not as though we at SBM haven‚Äôt explained this many times before and analyzed examples of some of these studies. In fact, we have a sampling of them here:
    >https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/?p=1

So having to rummage through all this with its broken links and varied relevance is the best that we on SBM can offer?    That is pathetic.   Similarly, but less so, with  Lilady‚Äôs references.  Surely there is one site that we can refer people to to access a simple summary of the key points and the most  critical evidence      
The CDC  only offers evidence on imputed mechanisms such as thiomerosal and certain claims regarding MMR vaccine.       

I realize this list is hopelessly out of date; we do need to update it. It is, however, a sampling, and not even a comprehensive one by any means. Perhaps I could ask Peter a question: What studies lead you to believe that there might be a link between vaccines and autism? Which specific studies make you uncertain?

Normal scientific caution should apply here,  as elsewhere where evidence is not wholly conclusive for the intended purpose.   
On his blog post The Alleged Autism Epidemic Steve Novella shows how, when he says: ‚Äù
The current state of evidence strongly suggests that the dominant reason for the increase in numbers is due to changes in diagnostic behavior.
There are many similar epidemiological questions in the world of medicine. I am content to let the chips fall where they may, and will gladly alter my opinion as new evidence comes in.‚Äù
I have no argument with the ‚Äúcurrent state of the evidence strongly suggests ‚Äî ‚Äú.   That is the proper voice of science.  . Steve is also allowing that all knowledge is tentative to some degree and subject to revision on good evidence..     He elsewhere goes as far as saying that the available evidence should easily have demonstrated a 5 or 6 fold increase in autism incidence,  which is also fair enough comment, but well short of what others are claiming.    
Moreover, we are talking about risk here.   Elsewhere we do apply lower standards of evidence for risk than we do for efficacy or matters of fact.  We issue warnings about even the potential for risk.      
Weirdly, we don‚Äôt claim that vaccines carry NO risk in other respects, yet we were striving for such a position on autism even before there were many studies at all looking at the question.  I suppose there was an immediate threat to vaccination rates, and we were reacting to that, and some entirely unlikely theories as much as any solid evidence.  That has come back to bite us.   We have manoeuvred ourselves into being required to provide something approaching absolute proof of no connection at all, when we know full well that that  is an impossible task, also that our failure to do so will be held against us.  
I am as guilty as any.   You David, have even created a situation where you have been publicly challenged by an antivax identity to present evidence on certain matters and you have been forced to choose that point to break off public discussions that you had up until then enthusiastically engaged in.   It looks bad (‚Äúwhat are they hiding?‚Äù).    I let that pass at the time, biting my tongue fiercely.      
 What we can prove is that IF there is such a risk it is very much lower than  some parties suggest and still much less than the risks that the same children will be exposed to if vaccination rates drop (as Harriet rightly says).   
This is NOT a normal scientific debate where you can get away with ‚Äúwell, there‚Äôs no real evidence of that!‚Äù    In normal everyday medical science ‚Äúabsence of evidence‚Äù  usually does equate, more or less,  for practical purposes, to ‚Äúevidence of absence‚Äù, partly through habitual modes of thought, but more fundamentally  for reasons of economy of endeavor.     
How sensible  is it to expect  concerned mothers (and fathers) to quietly go along with that?   It is disrespectful of them to  expect them to quietly knuckle under to medical authority and its standards,  and its pontifications that  ‚Äúthere is no evidence‚Äù, when  everywhere else they are hearing about the ‚Äúautism epidemic‚Äù, and how supposedly  perfectly normal children went downhill after vaccines, and how doctors have no satisfactory other explanation for higher rates of autism, and ‚Äúanyway doctors would probably think the risks of not vaccinating are greater but I am not so sure in my situation‚Äù.  
Not only that, but we now have a public that is increasingly aware (since we tell them so) how scientific studies are not as trustworthy as we once thought, through their susceptibility to bias.
So I think there are some grounds for thinking carefully about our approach to these matters.    You should be thinking about what is in mothers‚Äô minds, not mine.

I‚Äôm giving you the benefit of the doubt here by assuming that you don‚Äôt realize that you‚Äôve just used (inadvertently, apparently) a classic crank strategy. That being said, however, I‚Äôm disappointed. I had assumed that you knew that medical science doesn‚Äôt work that way. No single study ever settles anything, positively or negatively, and it is utterly impossible for a single study to rule out with 100% certainty (which is what you appear to be demanding) any possible causal association between vaccines and autism.
That‚Äôs a huge straw man anyway, because that‚Äôs not what I said. You focus on my ‚Äúwhiff of a hint‚Äù analogy, which is an accurate assessment of the state of the totality of the existing evidence, particularly when you take into account my further comments on the issue:
The bottom line, is that there is no scientific controversy over whether vaccines cause autism. The question has been asked multiple times and answered multiple times: No. Of course, being a scientist, I have to qualify that just a little bit by saying that ‚Äúno‚Äù means that we can‚Äôt detect an effect above the noise level of the epidemiological studies that have been done. In other words, even if there is an effect, it is so small that it can‚Äôt be detected by current epidemiological methods, which can detect pretty darned small effects. For all intents and purposes, as far as science can tell, vaccines do not cause autism. Neither does the mercury in the thimerosal preservative that until 2001 was used in many childhood vaccines. They just don‚Äôt; scientists have moved on, regardless of what antivaccinationists claim.
Please, Peter, tell me how the above passage doesn‚Äôt do exactly what you have been demanding. I‚Äôd really like to know. I also remind you that I‚Äôve answered your demand. I provided a link that lists not just one study but many studies that address the question.. Did you bother to read any of them? I sincerely doubt that you did, which is why I think that listing more (which I could easily do) would be a waste of my time. You appear to be perseverating over that one phrase and ignoring everything else I wrote (such as the passage above). That is cherry picking.
I really did think you understood science a bit better. It is the totality of existing evidence that must be taken into account. That means not just the multiple epidemiological studies that have failed to find a whiff of a hint of a correlation between vaccines and autism, but also everything else we know about autism, such as studies suggesting that it is mostly genetic, structural abnormalities found in the brains of children with autism, what we know about the neurobiology of autism, and many other converging strands of science. Now, you might be right in that the public doesn‚Äôt understand that there is not and never will be ‚Äújust one study‚Äù that forever banishes the contention that vaccines cause autism to the realm of discredited hypotheses (although lots of studies, taken together, do). The answer to that is not to acknowledge more uncertainty than there is (which is what you appear to want). There really isn‚Äôt much uncertainty at all from a scientific standpoint. The answer it to educate parents on how science really works, not how they think it works.

<p>You do realize, don&#8217;t you, that this sort of question is the same tactic that J.B.

Apparently, the concern about the effects of  stimulating the immune response by administering the seasonal flu vaccine along with  the H1N1 seasonal flu vaccine to pregnant women, is no longer ‚Äúunknown‚Äù.
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_127090.html
‚ÄúA Danish study that included more than 53,000 pregnant women, 13 percent of whom received the H1N1 vaccine, found no increased risk of major birth defects or pregnancy problems.
‚ÄúWe compared the vaccinated with the unvaccinated pregnancies with respect to a number of adverse events ‚Äî major birth defects, premature birth and fetal growth problems. None of these adverse events were more common among H1N1-vaccinated pregnancies. We conclude that H1N1-vaccinated pregnancies are not at increased risk of these adverse events,‚Äù said Dr. Anders Hviid, a senior investigator at Statens Serum Institut, in Copenhagen.‚Äù

Has anyone come up with a citation for P Moran‚Äôs statement about febrile seizures post immunization?
‚ÄúHarriet, I doubt if vaccines cause autism, although I do have to wonder, as a non-neurologist, whether severe febrile convulsions after some vaccines could be a triggering or exacerbating factor in the susceptible (Dr Novella?).‚Äù 
And then this statement from P Moran, that clarified his dismissive answer to me‚Ä¶
‚ÄúYou misunderstand. I made a simple query, and found your link only mildly reassuring for the reasons that I mentioned. I am not saying that there is such a link. I do want to be prepared for that claim. There is no doubt that at some point this question will come up, if only because autistics are prone to epilepsy and presumably also to febrile convulsions after those vaccines that provoke fever. There is scope for another spurious causal theory.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt misunderstand P Moran, and all your rephrasing and posturing doesn‚Äôt change the facts of these studies of reported ‚Äúvaccine encephalopathy‚Äù, due to DTP vaccinations.

And I understand why.  I once would have been as defensive and as circling of the wagons as you if confronted with a critique like mine.  We scientists  can‚Äôt stand anyone suggesting we might be wrong about anything and this is, in part, why some of us may not be dealing with CAM and anti-vaxers and fellow medicos with differing opinions with sufficient sophistication.        
My approach to medical fraud and quackery has evolved from something like David‚Äôs, partly through a very long process of talking to the people whose minds we wish to influence but also through an obsessive examination of my own positions in the mirror.   I was forced to ask whether I was part of the problem that I was trying to resolve.   
Incidently, there is nothing odd about my position(s).   A large chunk of mainstream medicine is more relaxed about CAM ( in some ways)  than us.  Note how ‚Äúwe‚Äù (on this occasion meaning Steve, Kimball, David and others) complain bitterly about that all the time.   It may be equally valid to ask the holders of those intense views to justify their stances in what is currently a very complex medical and political slurry.      
In that vein, if you want to weigh in regarding present matters,  what about you providing an example of a study that disproves any possible causal association of vaccines with autism?   I am agreeing that ‚Äúthe evidence is consistent with there being no strong link‚Äù or some such moderately strong statement, but we are talking about the ‚Äúwhiff of a hint‚Äù level of vehemence we have already conveyed to the opposite camp.    This is no joke.  Nor is it a debating strategy.  We are being asked to produce just that evidence by vaccination critics.    It must be dealt with.
I think I have provided enough information above, for now.  I will try and attract your attention next time I have one of these matters to comment upon.

We scientists  can&#8217;t stand anyone suggesting we might be wrong about anything and this is, in part, why some of us may not be dealing with <abbr title=""Complementary and Alternative Medicine"">CAM</abbr> and anti-vaxers and fellow medicos with differing opinions with sufficient sophistication.        </p>
<p>My approach to medical fraud and quackery has evolved from something like David&#8217;s, partly through a very long process of talking to the people whose minds we wish to influence but also through an obsessive examination of my own positions in the mirror.   I was forced to ask whether I was part of the problem that I was trying to resolve.   </p>
<p>Incidently, there is nothing odd about my position(s).   A large chunk of mainstream medicine is more relaxed about <abbr title=""Complementary and Alternative Medicine"">CAM</abbr> ( in some ways)  than us.  Note how &#8220;we&#8221; (on this occasion meaning Steve, Kimball, David and others) complain bitterly about that all the time.   It may be equally valid to ask the holders of those intense views to justify their stances in what is currently a very complex medical and political slurry.      </p>
<p>In that vein, if you want to weigh in regarding present matters,  what about you providing an example of a study that disproves any possible causal association of vaccines with autism?   I am agreeing that &#8220;the evidence is consistent with there being no strong link&#8221; or some such moderately strong statement, but we are talking about the &#8220;whiff of a hint&#8221; level of vehemence we have already conveyed to the opposite camp.    This is no joke.  Nor is it a debating strategy.  We are being asked to produce just that evidence by vaccination critics.    It must be dealt with.</p>
<p>I think I have provided enough information above, for now.  I will try and attract your attention next time I have one of these matters to comment upon.</p>

let‚Äôs face it, drugs are not beneficial for biological systems, they do not cure. Nutrition, high-dose nutritional supplements and herbal medicines do.
So you ‚Äòve got a couple logical and factual errors here.  The term ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù is pretty loaded.  If you define ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù as ‚Äúhelping a biological system perform its function‚Äù, you are correct.  Drugs are not beneficial in that they interfere.  But if you define beneficial as ‚Äúreducing morbidity, mortality and symptoms for the whole organism‚Äù, drugs are fantastic.  They interrupt processes which are pathological, such as febrile seizures, liver failure, blood clots causing strokes and countless others.  Antibiotics certainly disrupt the biological systems of bacteria, hooray!  Antivenom interrupts the effects of venom.  Analgesics reduce pain.  Unless you consider death by systematic infection or snake venom or the experience of preventable pain to be good things, I say hooray for drugs.  
Nutrition has a strong role in human health.  At a minimum, proper nutrition prevents scurvy, beri-beri, goitre and other deficiencies.  Whole foods eaten in appropriate amounts also seem to have a role in preventing cancers.  Proper nutrition with a balance of micronutrients and macronutrients, in conjunction with adequate exercise and ideally excellent genetics, is extremely good at preventing lifestyle conditions like obesity, heart disease and type II diabetes.  But there are very few conditions for which high dose vitamins are a treatment.  I know of the use of high-dose vitamin K to counteract acute doses of anticoagulants, and high-dose niacin for various blood lipids.  However, the results come with a cost ‚Äì anosmia for niacin (not to mention lack of effectiveness in decreasing deaths and increased risk of stroke) and though rare, hypervitaminosis K also has risks.  
Not that herbal medicine contributed anything to this knowledge.  We had ‚Äúherbal medicine‚Äù for millenia before we had real medicine, and it apparently was far, far less helpful than vaccination and water treatment ‚Äì both based on empirical research producing the germ theory of disease.  This is compared to herbal medicine, which brought us the idea ‚Äúif it looks like an eye, it‚Äôs good for the eye because of God‚Äù.  
So while nutrition does cure (more accurately, cures deficiencies and prevents lifestyle conditions), high-dose vitamins do not, bar a few rare exceptions, and herbal medicines for the most part don‚Äôt.  Plants evolved biological active molecules for their benefits, not ours.

  The bottom line, is that there is no scientific controversy over whether vaccines cause autism. The question has been asked multiple times and answered multiple times: No. Of course, being a scientist, I have to qualify that just a little bit by saying that ‚Äúno‚Äù means that we can‚Äôt detect an effect above the noise level of the epidemiological studies that have been done. In other words, even if there is an effect, it is so small that it can‚Äôt be detected by current epidemiological methods, which can detect pretty darned small effects. For all intents and purposes, as far as science can tell, vaccines do not cause autism. Neither does the mercury in the thimerosal preservative that until 2001 was used in many childhood vaccines. They just don‚Äôt; scientists have moved on, regardless of what antivaccinationists claim.
This is scarcely more measured a statement than your ‚Äî
Multiple large, well-designed epidemiological studies comprising, taken together, many hundreds of thousand of children that fail to find a whiff of a hint of a wisp of a correlation between vaccination and autism prevalence or onset.
 ‚Äî and still considerably stronger than Steve Novella‚Äôs  ‚Äî
   the evidence did not support a link between vaccines in general, the MMR vaccine specifically, or thimerosal in vaccines with autism or any neurodegenerative disorder. I did not begin my investigation with that conclusion‚Äù. 
 or his ‚Äî  
‚Äúthe now ‚Äúdiscredited notion that vaccines are a significant cause of autism ‚Äù  (my emphasis).
This last is more or less what I, and I believe scientists would support without question..   
Does the different mode of expression matter?   Not much in scientific circles.  Other scientists might think you are overstating the case a little without being bothered enough to comment on it.   
Those who already trust us and need minimal reassurance will also not bother to think further on it.    Likewise no regular reader of SBM  would  dare challenge it, other than this annoying, tone-trolling, contrarian.   Harriet sees no problem with it.  Is there also a risk that more moderate language will be interpreted as admitting there IS a risk?  
So do we let that become the standard answer to the  generic meta-question : ‚Äî  whether vaccines can somehow affect the expression and/or onset of autistic tendencies in some children?
Let‚Äôs think.  Does the end justify the means anyway?  We oppose that viewpoint elsewhere.  
Perhaps also the target audience matters.   Once you enter into public dialogue with anti-vax and ‚Äúvaccine safety‚Äù identities you are entering a very different arena to that which SBM represents.  
There you will certainly come into dialogue with many  people who have been under the influence of other evidence (to them) concerning an ‚Äúautism epidemic‚Äù and the stories about children going downhill after vaccines.  These folk already suspect that doctors may not be being perfectly honest in this matter.   It is not easy to overcome that but a simple matter to make it worse.  All you have to do is make dogmatic claims but then suddenly find  the claimed studies hard to produce.    The level of certainty expressed does produce a subtle shift in where the onus that of ‚Äúproof‚Äù (to the extent that such a thing is possible)  lies in many minds.    
Of course nothing will influence some minds but we ought to still present our case in the best way we can devise.     
Even after presenting all the evidence some listeners will still wonder whether bias has influenced the interpretation of the studies.   I contend that they will be less likely to do so when provided with transparent process and the cautious language of normal scientific discourse. That is full of desirable caveats, such as those you hint at above and as implied within such expressions as ‚Äúthe currently available evidence suggests ‚Äî‚Äú.
I have also been challenged to say what I  would do instead.    Well, I began this thread by indicating that I would not start off  with the off-putting ‚Äúme smart ‚Äì not so sure about you‚Äù  implication and the scant relevancy of ‚Äúcorrelation does not indicate causation‚Äù .  I would work away directly at the perceptions that I know are worrying more reasonable minds, placing  less poorly deserved emphasis on absurdist extremes.   
Otherwise I would merely favor Steve‚Äôs careful use of words and avoid the making of statements that we have no way of easily supporting.

A prior is OK when it refers to for example the prevalence of a disease, or when you have some kind of statistics about it. But when it is merely a thing in the mind, a plausibility based on gut feelings, well, ‚Ä¶.
But no one knows the true prevalence of the disease; we only have estimates, so our knowledge of the prevalence is just ‚Äúa thing in the mind,‚Äù too.  You use the fact that it is our knowledge that is ‚Äúrandom‚Äù (the correct term is ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù) or ignore it, depending on the point you‚Äôre trying to make.
I really don‚Äôt know how this whole story would have to be repeated if it was told with 1 toss (‚Äòheads‚Äô) with one symmetric coin. It would not give you any information at all.
It is impossible to determine what ‚Äúit‚Äù refers to in your sentence above.  My best guess is that you are trying to make the point that the prior would be useless.  If so, then you‚Äôve got it completely backward.  What is almost completely useless would be the single coin flip.  A frequentist approach to estimate the probability p of ‚Äúheads‚Äù for an ordinary coin that uses a very small number of trials fails miserably.  For the example of a single flip, the maximum likelihood estimate of p will be either 1, if the coin lands ‚Äúheads,‚Äù or 0, if the coin lands ‚Äútails.‚Äù  Either result is obviously a terrible estimate.  Why do we know this?  Because we have a lot of prior knowledge about ordinary coins.  And our estimate of p will clearly be improved by incorporating this prior knowledge into our estimate, as I now show:
What is a reasonable model for my prior knowledge about p?  I doubt that p is precisely .5.  An ordinary coin probably has a little bias in it, but I have no idea in which direction it is.  This suggests that the distribution I choose to model my prior should be symmetrical, narrow, and centered at .5.  Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm 95% confident that p is in the interval (.48, .52).  This suggests that the beta(1300,1300) distribution would be a reasonable model for my prior beliefs‚Äîit is symmetrical, has a mean of .5, and has 95% of its probability between .48 and .52.  Additionally, it has the weight of 2,600 coin flips, reflecting the fact that I have a lot of prior knowledge about p, and therefore, if I do an experiment with a small number of trials, the weight of my prior information will dominate the weight of the experimental evidence in my computed estimate of p.  In order to overcome the weight of my prior beliefs about p, I would need to conduct a large experiment‚Äîthat is, gather a lot of knew evidence about p.

<p>But no one knows the true prevalence of the disease; we only have estimates, so our knowledge of the prevalence is just &#8220;a thing in the mind,&#8221; too.  You use the fact that it is our knowledge that is &#8220;random&#8221; (the correct term is &#8220;uncertain&#8221;) or ignore it, depending on the point you&#8217;re trying to make.</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine what &#8220;it&#8221; refers to in your sentence above.  My best guess is that you are trying to make the point that the prior would be useless.  If so, then you&#8217;ve got it completely backward.  What is almost completely useless would be the single coin flip.  A frequentist approach to estimate the probability <i>p</i> of &#8220;heads&#8221; for an ordinary coin that uses a very small number of trials fails miserably.  For the example of a single flip, the maximum likelihood estimate of <i>p</i> will be either 1, if the coin lands &#8220;heads,&#8221; or 0, if the coin lands &#8220;tails.&#8221;  Either result is obviously a terrible estimate.  Why do we know this?  Because we have a lot of prior knowledge about ordinary coins.  And our estimate of <i>p</i> will clearly be improved by incorporating this prior knowledge into our estimate, as I now show:</p>
<p>What is a reasonable model for my prior knowledge about <i>p</i>?  I doubt that <i>p</i> is precisely .5.  An ordinary coin probably has a <i>little</i> bias in it, but I have no idea in which direction it is.  This suggests that the distribution I choose to model my prior should be symmetrical, narrow, and centered at .5.  Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m 95% confident that <i>p</i> is in the interval (.48, .52).  This suggests that the <a href=""http://jt512.dyndns.org/images/beta-1300-1300.png"" rel=""nofollow"">beta(1300,1300)</a> distribution would be a reasonable model for my prior beliefs‚Äîit is symmetrical, has a mean of .5, and has 95% of its probability between .48 and .52.  Additionally, it has the weight of 2,600 coin flips, reflecting the fact that I have a lot of prior knowledge about <i>p</i>, and therefore, if I do an experiment with a small number of trials, the weight of my prior information will dominate the weight of the experimental evidence in my computed estimate of <i>p</i>.  In order to overcome the weight of my prior beliefs about <i>p</i>, I would need to conduct a large experiment‚Äîthat is, gather a lot of knew evidence about <i>p</i>.  <i>This is exactly how rational inference should work when our prior knowledge is strong.</i></p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s say we conduct our 1-flip experiment to estimate <i>p</i> and it lands &#8220;heads.&#8221;  The frequentist estimate‚Äîthe maximum likelihood estimate‚Äîis p=1.  The Bayesian estimate is quite different.  Combining our new experimental evidence and our prior knowledge results in the posterior distribution for <i>p</i> being the beta(1301,1300) distribution.

Consider coin tossing. Is the result of my next toss fixed? What on earth do I gain by thinking that it is? 
This has been addressed by Scott. I‚Äôd like to give an example that is worked out somewhat more. I have tossed a ‚Äòdie‚Äô whose sides were in the ratio 3:3:2 .
I tossed it 200 times (I actually did!) It fell on one its two 3√ó3 sides 163 times. Just for brevity, I‚Äôll call such a throw a flat.
Now I think it is plausible that such a die has a precisely computable chance to fall on its flat side. But I am too stupid to compute that chance, I wouldn‚Äôt even know how to. It is possible that the chance crucially depends on the initial amount an direction of rotation if the die is released and if after that it doesn‚Äôt bounce often enough before it comes to rest. 
What is that chance? I can compute that if the ‚Äòreal‚Äô chance is about 0.754 I would find ‚Äò163 flats or more in 200 throws‚Äô only 2.5% of the time. Similarly when the ‚Äòreal‚Äô chance would have been 0.866, then ‚Äò163 flats or less in 200 throws‚Äô would have a chance of happening only 2.5% of the time. In this manner I translate the result of the chance experiment ‚Äò163 flats in 200 flats‚Äô into an interval [0.754 , 0.866] .  Another result, for example 162 flats or 164 flats ‚Äì which I might obtain just as easily, I guess ‚Äì would produce another interval. We call an interval like that an 95% confidence interval. It‚Äôs a bit of a funny calculation, because the boundaries are not defined in the same way. I think it is roughly correct to say that in 95% of the experiments one does, the calculated confidence interval will contain the calculated real probability of a flat. I think this is not entirely correct in this case, because in most of these kind of computations it is assumed that in all cases the variances are the same and here they are not. All the same the confidence interval is the outcome of a chance experiment.  As Scott put it: when you measure the restmass of an electron and you get a 95% confidence interval of 500 keV to 520 keV, then that interval summarizes your measurement and its degree of randomness. It is not the charge of the electron (as a matter of fact 519.9989‚Ä¶ keV) that is the random variable but all the random effects that influence the measurement. It‚Äôs that interval that has a certain probability of falling over the real value. 
How would the Bayesian approach be to the question: what does this 163/200 tell us about the real flat chance? The Bayesian approach needs to have prior probabilities for all possible ‚Äòflat chances‚Äô. That looks like a serious problem, because where do we get those prior probabilities?
Let‚Äôs make a table with pattern
real flat chance = p ; prior probability that p is correct =  x ;  probability P of getting the result 163/200, assuming p;  posterior probability that p is correct, knowing that the result 163/200 has happened = xP
Now I can produce a P for every p but in no case I know x. So I simplify my table and give only p and P.
p= 0.915   P=0.0000004
p= 0.865   P=0.01
p= 0.815   P=0.07     (0.815 = 163/200)
p= 0.765   P=0.02
p= 0.715   P=0.0003
p= 0.665   P=0.0000001
Now if those unknown x (the prior probabilities) don‚Äôt vary too wildly the combined table of the Px would still have a peak near 0.815 . If I would do 2000 tosses rather than this measly 200 the peak would be even more narrow. This illustrates the bayesian philosophy that if you repeat a chance experiment often enough, the fraction of successes converges to the real chance and the prior really doesn‚Äôt matter much. But then Ockham kicks in who would think that this prior is one of the entia we can easily do without. 
A prior is OK when it refers to for example the prevalence of a disease, or when you have some kind of statistics about it. But when it is merely a thing in the mind, a plausibility based on gut feelings, well, ‚Ä¶.
I really don‚Äôt know how this whole story would have to be repeated if it was told with 1 toss (‚Äòheads‚Äô) with one symmetric coin. It would not give you any information at all. 
What use is this information? Well, it tells me that there is no easy way to make a guess it the probabilities for an A:B:C die. Any simple argument like the relative area of the sides, or area divided by distance as indicative for the chance of coming to rest on that side cannot explain the factor 8 or 10 in chance of falling on a single large or small face of my die. Of course such a siomple argument might be correct after all, but then the result 163/200 would be an extremely freakish accident. 
I would like to point out that homeopaths (especially my compatriot A.L.B. Rutten who may have parroted from someone else) think that Bayseian statistics can help them. They estimate their prior not from the history of science in the past 200 years, but from the experience of homeopaths in their consulting rooms. Need I say more?

Any simple argument like the relative area of the sides, or area divided by distance as indicative for the chance of coming to rest on that side cannot explain the factor 8 or 10 in chance of falling on a single large or small face of my die. Of course such a siomple argument <i>might</i> be correct after all, but then the result 163/200 would be an extremely freakish accident. </p>
<p>I would like to point out that homeopaths (especially my compatriot A.L.B. Rutten who may have parroted from someone else) think that Bayseian statistics can help them. <i>They</i> estimate <i>their</i> prior not from the history of science in the past 200 years, but from the experience of homeopaths in their consulting rooms. Need I say more?</p>

What I think you are saying is that if the prior probability of the hypothesis is 0.5, then the posterior probability that a positive result is false is approximately equal to the prior probability that a positive result will be false‚Äî0.05 in David‚Äôs example‚Äîand, therefore, that if the investigator ignores the effect of the prior probability of the hypothesis and acts as if the p-value is the posterior probability of a false positive, he is, in effect, behaving as if his prior probability for the hypothesis is 0.5.

(.05)(1 ‚Äì .5) / [(.05)(1 ‚Äì .5) + (.8)(.5)] = .06 ,
shows that the posterior probability of a false negative is .06, which is indeed close to the prior probability for a false negative of .05.
However, if we redo the calculation using a power of .4,
(.05)(1 ‚Äì .5) / [(.05)(1 ‚Äì .5) + (.4)(.5)] = .11 ,
we get a posterior false positive probability of .11, more than double the prior probability of a false positive.  Ignoring the effect of the prior probability of the hypothesis in this case, and treating the critical p-value as if it were the probability of the positive result being false, is equivalent to having a prior probability for the hypothesis of 0.7:
(.05)(1 ‚Äì .7) / [(.05)(1 ‚Äì .7) + (.4)(.7)] = .05 .

"344823","163","133746",,"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/battling-antivaccinationists-at-freedomfest/",,"What would constitute a killer blow? I suspect nothing could meet that criterion.
Exactly. To Peter, apparently nothing constitutes a ‚Äúkiller blow‚Äù‚Äîor could ever constitute such a blow. No matter how much evidence there is, he asks for more and insists that there is more scientific uncertainty than there in fact is. Why he does this, I don‚Äôt know, because if there‚Äôs a form of quackery that does easily demonstrable harm to children, it‚Äôs antivaccine quackery. The fact that he objected to my quite reasonable discussion of the tiny level of uncertainty there is in the current scientific consensus speaks volumes, as does his utter failure to produce countering evidence to support his contention that I overstate the case for vaccine safety with respect to autism causation.
Peter also fetishizes Steve‚Äôs allegedly ‚Äúmore moderate‚Äù stance. He wasn‚Äôt at the debate, however. I was. So readers will just have to believe me when I assure them that, for all his politeness, at the core Steve was just as strong as I was in this post‚Äîperhaps more so than I was in this post‚Äîin stating publicly and unequivocally that science has asked and answered the question of whether vaccines cause autism and found the answer to be ‚Äúno.‚Äù (I paraphrase, but that‚Äôs what Steve said‚Äîpolitely but firmly, of course.) If Peter is going to be intellectually consistent, he therefore needs to criticize Steve for being too ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù and ‚Äúdogmatic,‚Äù as well, or consider that maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîhe‚Äôs bending over a bit too far backwards to seem ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù and ‚Äúeven-handed‚Äù and in doing so is elevating antivax arguments far above what they deserve based on science and evidence as well. As I recall, at one point Steve also stated that ‚Äúscience has moved on,‚Äù and he was right. Science has moved on from this question, except when forced to do the same studies again and again by activists, even though the same studies find the same thing again and again: There is no detectable correlation between vaccines and autism. Because when it comes to a vaccine-autism link, there‚Äôs just no ‚Äúthere‚Äù there. Meanwhile, Steve used the word ‚Äúdeception‚Äù or ‚Äúdeceive‚Äù several times to describe the sorts of evidence that Dr. Whitaker was using to support his claim that vaccines cause autism and are dangerous in other ways, in particular the two graphs he used.
Let‚Äôs compare. Let me take Peter‚Äôs tack on autism and vaccines when talking about, for instance, Gerson therapy: The evidence base for and against Gerson therapy is lousy; so maybe it works. Maybe there‚Äôs a basis for saying that we can‚Äôt rule out completely that it works, just as you say we can‚Äôt rule out completely a link between vaccines and autism. Or what about Laetrile? There really aren‚Äôt any large randomized clinical trials looking at Laetrile efficacy; maybe we should do one. Maybe it works. It is, after all, a drug, and there is much less evidence that it doesn‚Äôt work against cancer than there is that vaccines don‚Äôt cause autism! Yes,  Peter has a double standard, accepting perfectly reasonable evidence against cancer quackery, such as Laetrile or the Gerson therapy, as more than sufficient to state unequivocally that these therapies are dangerous quackery even though that evidence base doesn‚Äôt rise to the level of large randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In comparison, even though there is a much larger and robust evidence base that supports the hypothesis that vaccines do not cause autism, he insists that we should be going out of our way to leave the door open to a link. One wonders if he has actually made up his mind himself over whether there is a link. He says he has, but he writes as though he hasn‚Äôt. If that‚Äôs the case, one also wonders what evidence it would take to assuage his doubts.
In any case, seriously, Peter. I see where you‚Äôre coming from here, but I think that, in your effort to be empathetic and communicate you‚Äôve actually gone directly in the wrong direction. Your ideas make communication of vaccines benefits and risks with parents more, not less, difficult.

Or what about Laetrile? There really aren&#8217;t any large randomized clinical trials looking at Laetrile efficacy; maybe we should do one. Maybe it works. It is, after all, a drug, and there is much less evidence that it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> work against cancer than there is that vaccines don&#8217;t cause autism! Yes,  Peter has a double standard, accepting perfectly reasonable evidence against cancer quackery, such as Laetrile or the Gerson therapy, as more than sufficient to state unequivocally that these therapies are dangerous quackery even though that evidence base doesn&#8217;t rise to the level of large randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In comparison, even though there is a much larger and robust evidence base that supports the hypothesis that vaccines do not cause autism, he insists that we should be going out of our way to leave the door open to a link. One wonders if he has actually made up his mind himself over whether there is a link. He says he has, but he writes as though he hasn&#8217;t. If that&#8217;s the case, one also wonders what evidence it would take to assuage his doubts.</p>
<p>In any case, seriously, Peter. I see where you&#8217;re coming from here, but I think that, in your effort to be empathetic and communicate you&#8217;ve actually gone directly in the wrong direction. Your ideas make communication of vaccines benefits and risks with parents more, not less, difficult.</p>

So why aren‚Äôt statins available OTC?
Yes, there are rare but potentially very serious side effects.  Isn‚Äôt that why god made IFUs (package inserts)?  
There are very good reasons for some drugs to be available only by prescription; antibiotics leap to mind.  But many others could and should be available OTC ‚Äì as they are in a variety of foreign countries. 
How many hours of scarce and expensive physician time was spent asking Ms. Jones about her heartburn while proton pump inhibitors (prilosec et al) were prescription drugs?  Now they‚Äôre readily available in every drug store and supermarket.

‚ÄúSuggestions of hypercholesterolemia are easy enough for a person of reasonable intelligence to spot.‚Äù
Really? What do you mean by that? Most people who have elevated cholesterol levels aren‚Äôt usually aware of it until a blood test is done. And a titrated dose may not remain titrated, and side effects can‚Äôt be ‚Äúruled out.‚Äù Some of them can develop even after long usage. The fact that you apparently didn‚Äôt appreciate that underscores the value of consulting a doctor.
Now you are moving the goalposts. First you suggested statins should be available OTC and now you‚Äôre saying refills should not require a visit to a doctor, which is an entirely different matter. By the way, in my experience doctors usually write prescriptions for a year‚Äôs refills, not just 6 months.
There is value to a doctor‚Äôs appointment that may not be readily apparent to a patient: the entire risk status can be re-evaluated, other factors can be addressed that may have impact on the need for statins or the dosage, the doctor can ask about symptoms that the patient might not have connected to the drug, liver function can be monitored, and the doctor may have new information that might affect dosage, target numbers, or special populations. Just one example: one specific statin was recently found to interact with a certain BP med, and doctors were switching their patients to a different statin. Admittedly, pregnancy could be covered by a package insert warning, but new concerns can‚Äôt be foreseen.
The UK has an intermediate solution: a behind-the-counter option where a prescription is not required but a consultation with a pharmacist is.
FDA policies are certainly open to question; but as they currently stand, statins don‚Äôt meet the criteria they are using for designating a drug OTC. They have good reasons, but reasonable people may have other reasons to disagree with their decision.

I am fairly sure that if the boot was on the other foot David would be the one asking for studies of the type I asked for when he first made the ‚Äúwhiff of a hint‚Äù claim.
Of course, one notes that I provided a link with lots of studies to back up the scientific consensus that there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúwhiff of a hint‚Äù of an association between vaccines and autism. I could easily provide more, but what‚Äôs the point? You‚Äôll just dismiss them with a haughty wave of your hand as not being ‚Äúup to the normal standards of scientific proof.‚Äù
Papertrail, this would be the ‚Äúkiller blow‚Äù, so far as ‚Äúthe science‚Äù is concerned, and we both know why David is unable to deliver. Our case is quite strong, but it is based upon inferences from data from a lot of different sources none of which quite hits the sweet spot for normal standards of ‚Äúproof‚Äù.
Papertrail, that would be the ‚Äúkiller blow‚Äù that proves evolution, so far as ‚Äúthe science‚Äù is concerned, and we both know why evolutionists are unable to deliver. Our case is quite strong, but it is based upon inferences from data from a lot of different sources, none of which quitequite hits the sweet spot for normal standards of ‚Äúproof‚Äù.
Papertrail, that would be the ‚Äúkiller blow‚Äù that proves anthropogenic global warming, so far as ‚Äúthe science‚Äù is concerned, and we both know why climate scientists are unable to deliver. Our case is quite strong, but it is based upon inferences from data from a lot of different sources, none of which quite hits the sweet spot for normal standards of ‚Äúproof‚Äù.
Peter, in science, when we have many lines of evidence from different sources that all converge on the same conclusion, that is one of the ‚Äúnormal standards of proof.‚Äù In fact, your use of the word ‚Äúproof‚Äù demonstrates your problem. Scientists rarely, if ever, speak of ‚Äúproof.‚Äù They speak of evidence, and the evidence that vaccines do not cause autism is, by any reasonable standard of science, overwhelming to a very high degree of certainty, more so than a lot of things we accept as scientific consensus in medicine.
I again refer to the example of tobacco smoke. Do you believe that tobacco smoke causes lung cancer and heart disease? It‚Äôs a truism in medicine, but there has never been a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to demonstrate it and, for ethical reasons there never will be, just as there will never be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the current vaccination schedule versus no vaccines to test the hypothesis that vaccines cause or contribute to the development of autism. Indeed, as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware, in mouse studies, it‚Äôs very difficult to cause lung cancer with cigarette smoke (which was one of the arguments tobacco companies used to make to spread the proverbial ‚Äúfear, uncertainty, and doubt‚Äù‚ÄîFUD‚Äîabout the evidence linking smoking to cancer). Does that mean that there is sufficient doubt about cigarette smoke causing lung cancer that we should bring these things up every time we discuss it? No! The evidence that demonstrates the connection between tobacco smoke and lung cancer, for example, consists of a combination of epidemiological studies plus basic science studies demonstrating that chemicals in cigarette smoke can be carcinogenic. In other words, it consists of evidence from various different sources that all converge on the same conclusion.
Using your argument here, if you were to be intellectually consistent, you would have to conclude that there is still doubt that smoking causes lung cancer and chastise ‚Äúour side‚Äù (the American Cancer Society, for instance) for saying that smoking causes cancer. I look forward to such a statement from you, to demonstrate that you are not applying a double standard.
At this point, you seem to be just being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian on the issue of the evidence base. In fact, you clearly don‚Äôt even know the evidence base and haven‚Äôt bothered to investigate. Otherwise, you would be able to show me some studies.

Ahhh hypercholesterolemia is not easy to spot as it is asymptomatic, so we require blood tests to diagnose it.

What about hypothyroidism, after it‚Äôs diagnosed should the patient never require blood work or a new dosage ever again?

The answers to all, including hypercholesterolemia, is no (kind of a double negative here): patients need to be reevaluated for their conditions. I understand if you may think this is stretching it but how do you justify that disease vs others in terms of ‚Äúone and done?‚Äù

"344847","163","133746",,"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/battling-antivaccinationists-at-freedomfest/",,"It has been implied that I have changed my tune from dealing with cancer quackery. Not so. If you look at my web site you will find similar caution of expression, because it is deliberately addressing those with an interest in or with sympathy for CAM.
Hmmm. Let‚Äôs take a look at some of your statements from your website, shall we? For instance, let‚Äôs start with the main page:
If someone promoting a treatment to you as a possible cure is unable to produce contemporary facts and figures, and cannot introduce you to patients with well-documented cancer that went away with their treatment and that treatment alone, then you are entitled to regard them as a charlatan or crackpot.
Those claiming that patient privacy prevents such openness are frauds.  I never met a patient cured of cancer who was not happy to talk to others in the same predicament.  At worst the  promoters of the treatment  could forward information to your doctors, who share confidential information all the time..  
Those who have never published any clinical results (i.e. effects upon cancer in humans), not even in any of the many ‚Äúalternative‚Äù medical journals now in operation are likewise unworthy of your trust.  It is inconceivable that sane, moral persons  with an important cancer treatment would not wish to promote it in every way possible.  Books about cancer cures usually aren‚Äôt worth the paper they are written on.  Web sites are no better.  These are promotional materials targeting the lay public wherein the author can invent, select, exaggerate and misrepresent with impunity.
Strong words. Excellent words. All without a whiff of a hint of uncertainty included! You even referred to the quacks as charlatans and crackpots! I heartily approve! I can‚Äôt help but ask, though, Peter: Doesn‚Äôt the use of words like ‚Äúcrackpot,‚Äù ‚Äúcharlatan,‚Äù and ‚Äúfraud‚Äù risk offending people who are interested in or sympathetic to CAM? I might quibble that perhaps someone wanting a patent on his discovery might not want to promote it just yet, but such people are usually not selling their product and are instead engaged in gathering data to demonstrate that it works; so it‚Äôs fine.
There is one exception to my unvarnished praise. That bit about patient privacy was a rather harsh, blanket statement that goes too far even for me. (Yes, Peter, you showed more certainty and dogmatism on this issue than I would have.) I wouldn‚Äôt conclude that those who claim patient privacy are necessarily frauds. It is true that the vast majority of them probably are, but some of them are probably just true believers or genuinely believe they are protecting patients. In any case, in the US at least, we have the rather severe HIPAA privacy law. So, even for a legitimate practitioner, it‚Äôs not entirely unreasonable. That‚Äôs why it sounds so plausible when quacks say it. Oh, and I have met the occasional patient cured of cancer who didn‚Äôt want to talk to others. Anecdotal evidence to counter your anecdotal evidence.
Still, overall the sentiments are very good, and not at all the mushy, wishy-washy uncertainty that you seem to be advocating that we use when dealing with antivaccinationists now. You even accused cancer quacks of lying:
The patient always has the right to determine their own fate and run their own risks.   Treatment is by their choice, but ideally only after full and trustworthy informed consent. It is with the latter that ‚Äúalternative‚Äù sources habitually fall short when not frankly mendacious.
One notes that I‚Äôve written almost exactly the same thing more times than I can count. I even coined a term (‚Äúmisinformed consent‚Äù) to describe what it is that CAM practitioners and antivaccinationists use. Basically, they slant the data and story so much against vaccines or conventional treatment that a rational person faced with only this source of information would be foolish not to go along with what the quack wants.
Finally, I heartily approve of these words:
History shows that nothing can for long withstand the inevitable and relentless accrual of evidence that attends the valid claim ‚Äì not even the  dogma of a powerful religion,  in the case of Galileo‚Äôs. This would apply in triplicate to a cancer cure.  Little more than rumour and a few  dubious claims have been enough to provoke intense media interest and  public hysteria, and even force Government action in relation to some cancer ‚Äúcures‚Äù. Examples are Laetrile, the Di Bella treatment in Italy, and recently the Holt treatment in Australia.  Imagine the impact of even a handful of genuine cures of serious cancers.
One notes that there has never been a large randomized clinical trial of laetrile. There never was a randomized trial of the De Bella treatment. The trials done in Italy were open label in which the patients chose the therapy. The evidence base you require to reject these therapies is far weaker than the evidence base you appear to require to reject any ‚Äúwhiff of a hint‚Äù of an association between vaccines and autism.
Maybe you should revise your website in light of your more recent sentiments. However, I sincerely hope you don‚Äôt. I liked the old Peter Moran much better. I miss him. Your website is just fine as it is‚Äîan achievement of which you should be justly proud. In fact, I‚Äôd love to see more material like what‚Äôs there now. Indeed, the old Peter Moran was a guy who a decade ago, among others, inspired me to go into combatting cancer quackery in particular and quackery in general. (I even used his excellent post about breast cancer testimonials as the inspiration for one of my very first substantive posts on my other blog and still use it today in my talks about cancer quackery.)
I hardly recognize this new guy.

The practical problem that colors my discussion is how do you let published reports (which may report frequentest statistics or Bayes statistics) inform your practice of medicine. By the very nature of the way I have stated the problem, I am using a Bayes view of probability. So really I am looking at how to incorporate a report using a frequentest approach into my Bayesian approach. The answer to my dilemma does not answer any theoretical questions. It only leads me to a better strategy of incorporating frequentest statistics in my Bayesian approach.
Biomedical research findings are almost always reported using frequentist statistics.  A frequentist hypothesis test is conducted, and the results are reported as some combination of an effect estimate (eg, improvement in the active treatment arm minus improvement in the placebo arm), hazard ratio, test statistic (eg, t or chi-squared value), standard error or confidence interval for the effect estimate or hazard ratio, and p-value from the test.  In order to incorporate such frequentist test results into rational medical decisions, we must convert them into Bayesian statistics.  This is easier to do than you might think.
Our aim is to convert a frequentist hypothesis test into a Bayesian hypothesis test.  To do so we need to compute the Bayes factor, which is, in a sense, the Bayesian analogue to the frequentist‚Äôs p-value.  The Bayes factor, BF, compares the likelihood of the data under two competing hypotheses: the null hypothesis (no effect; eg, the drug does not differ from placebo) vs an alternative hypothesis (eg, the drug is more (or less) effective than placebo).  The Bayes factor, which ranges from zero to infinity, tells us how much the study results should alter our prior odds that the null hypothesis is true.  Multiplication of the Bayes factor by our prior odds gives us the posterior odds that the null hypothesis is true:
(prior odds) √ó BF = (posterior odds) .
Bayes factors greater than 1 imply that the data favor the null hypothesis over the alternative; less than 1, that the data favor the alternative hypothesis over the null; and equal to 1, that the data do not favor either hypothesis over the other.
Note that when using the Bayes factor, the prior and posterior values must be expressed as odds, not probabilities.  Odds are defined as follows:
Probability / (1 ‚Äì Probability) .
For example, if we have a prior probability of 0.8, we have prior odds of .8/.2=4.  Like the Bayes factor, odds range from 0 to infinity, with odds of 1 being equivalent to a probability of 0.5.
After we calculate our posterior odds, we can, if we wish, convert the result back into a probability as follows:
Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds) .
So the question is, how do we convert frequentist hypothesis test results reported in biomedical research papers into Bayes factors?  If the statistical test in the paper is a t-test or a result from linear regression, we can use the appropriate applet at Jeff Rouder‚Äôs web site.  Or, if the test result is reported as a hazard ratio, we can use the method I‚Äôve described on my website.  Don‚Äôt be put off by the math.  Most of it is there for background purposes.  The Bayes factor is calculated using Equation 15, and Equations 12‚Äì14 are used to calculate numbers needed by Equation 15 if they are not reported explicitly in the paper.  The web page includes a worked example under the heading ‚ÄúExample: Red Meat and Mortality.‚Äù
If you have any questions you can post them here or as a comment on my web site.

<p>Bayes factors greater than 1 imply that the data favor the null hypothesis over the alternative; less than 1, that the data favor the alternative hypothesis over the null; and equal to 1, that the data do not favor either hypothesis over the other.</p>
<p>Note that when using the Bayes factor, the prior and posterior values must be expressed as odds, not probabilities.  Odds are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Probability / (1 ‚Äì Probability) .</p>
<p>For example, if we have a prior probability of 0.8, we have prior odds of .8/.2=4.  Like the Bayes factor, odds range from 0 to infinity, with odds of 1 being equivalent to a probability of 0.5.</p>
<p>After we calculate our posterior odds, we can, if we wish, convert the result back into a probability as follows:</p>
<p>Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds) .</p>
<p>So the question is, how do we convert frequentist hypothesis test results reported in biomedical research papers into Bayes factors?  If the statistical test in the paper is a t-test or a result from linear regression, we can use the <a href=""http://pcl.missouri.edu/bayesfactor"" rel=""nofollow"">appropriate applet</a> at Jeff Rouder&#8217;s web site.  Or, if the test result is reported as a hazard ratio, we can use the method I&#8217;ve described on <a href=""http://jt512.dyndns.org/blog/?p=4"" rel=""nofollow"">my website</a>.  Don&#8217;t be put off by the math.  Most of it is there for background purposes.  The Bayes factor is calculated using Equation 15, and Equations 12‚Äì14 are used to calculate numbers needed by Equation 15 if they are not reported explicitly in the paper.  The web page includes a worked example under the heading &#8220;Example: Red Meat and Mortality.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have any questions you can post them here or as a comment on my web site.</p>

‚ÄúMy Verdict: No convincing effect, and certainly none on more advanced cases. A small beneficial effect not excluded but these are extremely disappointing results for the cancer thought to be most responsive to this very intense and life-consuming treatment method. 
In relation to  the Gonzales study I say 
‚ÄúThe final results of that study have been published   http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/JCO.2009.22.8429v1   They are disastrous for the Gonzales/Kelley (‚Äúenzyme‚Äù) approach.   
Due to small numbers of suitable patients accepting randomisation, the study had to be completed on the basis of patients choosing which treatment to receive.  This can introduce bias and there were small biases towards sicker patients in the Gonzales/Kelley  group such as more with distant metastases.   Gonzales also alleges that some of the patients allotted to him were too sick to follow or complete his treatment.  This is certainly possible.  Inoperable pancreatic cancer is a rapidly progressing and debilitating condition, and patients may have also exaggerated their ability to consume the required diets and handfuls of supplements in their eagerness to be accepted for the study.     
Yet even if we doubled the survival of the Gonzales/Kelley patients  at 10 months so as to completely exclude some obviously excessive early mortality in this group, there is still no indication of any beneficial influence from this complex regime over the average medical care that the SEER figures reflect..  
David said that this study showed chemotherapy produced three times better survival rates than Gonzales at some unspecified end point.   It is nowhere near a strong enough study to justify that claim, and for at least two obvious reasons.   
I wasn‚Äôt defending Gonzales when I objected to that.   I was defending the application of uniform standards to the interpretation of scientific evidence ‚Äî for the sake of one of our own mantras,  if not also to avoid some CAM bright spark using this as proof of our Big Pharm bias and OUR double standard in looking at evidence.   I won‚Äôt describe David‚Äôs reaction to this challenge to his scientific authority other than to say that it helped put a target on his back. 
I understand that we will all at times overstate our case, especially in informal discussions amongst ourselves.  But this is  a supposedly science-based forum that spends a great deal of its time being critical of the scientific standards and logic of others.    It also reaches out to a much wider audience every time it has dealings with CAM.

"344871","163","153484",,"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/battling-antivaccinationists-at-freedomfest/",,"I would like to second many of Peter‚Äôs statements in this thread.  I will provide a quote from an article in the Dec. 2009 issue of Neuron (a highly regarded journal), which I feel more accurately portrays the message that should be disseminated based on the extant scientific evidence. The article is entitled: ‚ÄúBreaking Boundaries in Neural-Immune Interactions‚Äù
Finally, neural-immune crosstalk also has profound implications for public health policy. Growing evidence that maternal immune activation could increase the incidence of autism or schizophrenia in offspring suggests that healthcare providers should revisit the pros and cons of using anti-inflammatory drugs in pregnancy with the goal of developing drugs that prevent a proinflammatory response in the CNS without damaging the fetus. Another issue for society right now is whether, and when, pregnant mothers should be given the seasonal flu and H1N1 vaccines. While the flu can be extremely harmful to pregnant women, the effects of stimulating the immune response with two flu vaccines during pregnancy are unknown.
Absent the luxury of waiting for large-scale study results, recommendations that pregnant women receive both vaccines are valid based on current knowledge of the dangers of natural flu infection during gestation. However, since the negative effects of immune stimulation during pregnancy are likely determined by susceptibility factors, our understanding of factors that cause aberrant baseline immune responses in some pregnant women must be improved and better methods for susceptibility screening developed soon.
 It is also important to note that neuralimmune crosstalk could be affected by the current schedule of childhood immunizations. Although there is some epidemiological evidence that immunizations are not likely to have a direct role in the ontogeny of autism (Immunization Safety Review Committee, 2004), it is still possible that responses to the number and combinations of vaccinations given at some visits could contribute to cognitive changes in children who may already have altered immune responses. Natural infections in an individual with a dysfunctional immune system might have an equally deleterious effect. Thus, a better understanding of the effects of immune activation during gestation and early postnatal development, especially in the context of increased disease susceptibility, will be critical to either validate our current health policies or modify them for specific populations of individuals.
This was written in 2009, since then an exponential increase in studies related to immune dysfunction/maternal immune activation and autism have been completed.  It is becoming more of a reality that immune dysfunction and maternal immune activation play a critical role in the ontogeny of a large cohort of children with autism.  When this fact is coupled with the relative dearth of information regarding specific immune reactions in infants from the normal vaccine schedule, including time dependent effects, one has to consider that it is a plausible avenue to further explore.
I think Peter‚Äôs suggestion that prospective epidemiological studies will be needed to more thouroughly understand the complex interrelations between vaccines, the developing immune system, and immune dysfunction in autism, is a very sound suggestion.  In fact, I have suggested this on a few occasions in the past.  Prospective nested case/control studies that take into account a number of relevant biomarkers will be the first step.  I have also suggested that there is no need to have a vax vs. unvax study to learn something that may be very important.  A completely vaxxed cohort would be just fine, it is in the details of what biomarkers are surveyed, genetic background, and time dependent effects that are of greater importance.
Lastly, I would like to second the idea that if you want to have any credence, picking the easy fruit isn‚Äôt how you are going to accomplish that.  I would find it a million times more instructive if Dr. Gorski, or Dr. Novella had debated someone like the author of the quote or Paul Patterson, both who are well regarded researchers in the fields of autism and neuroimmunology.  Both of these people are not antivaccine, but have orders of magnitude more knowledge regarding the neuroimmunological aspects of autism, which, in my mind is a prerequisite to intelligently discussing the vaccine/autism (link/non-link, I am still undecided).

@Justin re: Patterson.
I found more on his attitude about the flu vaccine for pregnant women.  Here‚Äôs an excerpt from a good article that interviewed him, not about flu shot and autism but schizophrenia (he probably would say the same about autism, but I‚Äôm not going to waste my money buying his book to find out).  In sum, he‚Äôs a bit schizoid himself when it comes to the connection. On the one hand, he announced that he wouldn‚Äôt want his own wife to get the flu shot while pregnant yet concedes that getting the flu itself could be much worse and recommends that everyone else‚Äôs pregnant wives should get the shot.  Too late, Patterson!  Once you tell the world that you wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to your own wife, that is the same thing as telling other pregnant women not to get the shot, regardless of admitting that the CDC are more expert on these matters yourself.  
‚ÄúThe research into the links between maternal flu and schizophrenia is still considered preliminary, which makes any policy conclusions premature, but scientists studying the connection are starting to worry.‚Äù 
‚Ä¶‚ÄùObviously, the safe thing to do is to go with the experts, and the experts are the CDC,‚Äù said Paul Patterson, a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology and one of the leading researchers into the link between maternal infections and schizophrenia. ‚ÄúHowever, if it was my wife, I would not [want] her vaccinated.‚Äù 
Patterson said he would try to protect a pregnant family member from the flu by suggesting she keep away from infected people and by enforcing a regimen of regular hand-washing among all family members. 
However, he conceded that such measures might not be as effective as flu shots and that women who get the flu because they don‚Äôt get a flu shot might not only put their future children at increased risk for schizophrenia, but also incur numerous other risks from the illness. Careful prevention techniques, moreover, are unlikely to help pregnant women who have toddlers, because small children tend to bring home endless streams of viral infections.‚Äù   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112301327.html

On the one hand, he announced that he wouldn&#8217;t want his own wife to get the flu shot while pregnant yet concedes that getting the flu itself could be much worse and recommends that everyone else&#8217;s pregnant wives should get the shot.  Too late, Patterson!  Once you tell the world that you wouldn&#8217;t recommend it to your own wife, that is the same thing as telling other pregnant women not to get the shot, regardless of admitting that the CDC are more expert on these matters yourself.  </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The research into the links between maternal flu and schizophrenia is still considered preliminary, which makes any policy conclusions premature, but scientists studying the connection are starting to worry.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8230;&#8221;Obviously, the safe thing to do is to go with the experts, and the experts are the CDC,&#8221; said Paul Patterson, a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology and one of the leading researchers into the link between maternal infections and schizophrenia. &#8220;However, if it was my wife, I would not [want] her vaccinated.&#8221; </p>
<p>Patterson said he would try to protect a pregnant family member from the flu by suggesting she keep away from infected people and by enforcing a regimen of regular hand-washing among all family members. </p>
<p>However, he conceded that such measures might not be as effective as flu shots and that women who get the flu because they don&#8217;t get a flu shot might not only put their future children at increased risk for schizophrenia, but also incur numerous other risks from the illness. Careful prevention techniques, moreover, are unlikely to help pregnant women who have toddlers, because small children tend to bring home endless streams of viral infections.&#8221;   <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112301327.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112301327.html</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>It seems likely to be about fever during pregnancy, not about the flu shot, per se:  <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/23/news/la-heb-fevers-pregnancy-autism-20120523"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/23/news/la-heb-fevers-pregnancy-autism-20120523</a></p>

Dr. Hall, you are a physician and your husband is the husband of a physician (and perhaps a physician himself).  While not a physician, I work in the medical industry and through contacts and friendships have a relationship with my primary care physician that allows many things to be handled with an e-mail or a phone call.

Many people have to book appointments weeks in advance, sit in waiting rooms long after their appointment time has come and gone, and never get year long prescriptions.

In point of fact while I can generally get a prescription with a phone call, I‚Äôve never had a 12 month prescription for anything.
‚Äúbut I can only assume that you asked it because you thought it would be a good idea‚Äù
I asked it because I thought it might be a good idea.   I‚Äôm still not convinced that it isn‚Äôt ‚Äì at least within the scope of something like the UK model of OTC w/ a pharmacist consult.  But I‚Äôm more interested in the larger issue of intelligently allocating scarce medical resources to achieve the greatest good for the most people (and hopefully at a cost more in line with other industrialized nations) than I am in the vagaries of statin prescriptions.  Statin prescription practices need to be critically examined just like other allocations.
‚ÄúThere are no studies showing the optimal time for refills, and in the absence of evidence, a year is a convenient guess.‚Äù
You say 12 months, another physician says three.  Where does clinical judgment stop and whim begin?

I graduated from the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine in 1997 with a Master‚Äôs Degree in Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine, funded largely by Sallie Mae.  My site has been around for years and there are some older layers of material there, sorry you couldn‚Äôt find my license info easily (http://www.ancientway.com/Pages/AcuLicense.html).  I don‚Äôt fit well into your (apparently) black and white world.  I‚Äôm open to criticism and discussion, though my acupuncturist ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù recently wore out my tolerance for ad hominem attacks with their response to my pointing out the exploitative fraud a particular herb company is marketing towards HIV/AIDS patients (http://ancientway.com/blog/?p=2309).  I‚Äôve pretty much had it with the TCM world, particularly since reading _Trick or Treatment_, _Snake Oil Science_ and related material over the past year.
I understand your opinion is that I can‚Äôt diagnose anything, but the law in Oregon says otherwise:
‚Äîbegin law from http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/677.html
      677.757 Definitions for ORS 677.757 to 677.770. As used in ORS 677.757 to 677.770:
      (1)(a) ‚ÄúAcupuncture‚Äù means an Oriental health care practice used to promote health and to treat neurological, organic or functional disorders by the stimulation of specific points on the surface of the body by the insertion of needles. ‚ÄúAcupuncture‚Äù includes the treatment method of moxibustion, as well as the use of electrical, thermal, mechanical or magnetic devices, with or without needles, to stimulate acupuncture points and acupuncture meridians and to induce acupuncture anesthesia or analgesia.
      (b) The practice of acupuncture also includes the following modalities as authorized by the Oregon Medical Board:
      (A) Traditional and modern techniques of diagnosis and evaluation;
      (B) Oriental massage, exercise and related therapeutic methods; and
      (C) The use of Oriental pharmacopoeia, vitamins, minerals and dietary advice.
      (2) ‚ÄúOriental pharmacopoeia‚Äù means a list of herbs described in traditional Oriental texts commonly used in accredited schools of Oriental medicine if the texts are approved by the Oregon Medical Board. [1993 c.378 ¬ß1]
‚Äîend law
I‚Äôve asked the Oregon Medical Board to clarify part A (specifically what diagnostic methods I can use) and also the list of texts in part 2 (which would seem to indicate that I can prescribe Cinnabar, Arsenic, or Opium Poppy Husks, as they are in the books my college used).  They said the Board would have to talk about it in December as these are complex and new questions.  Again, please note that I have no interest in using Pendulums in diagnosis or prescribing Cinnabar to epileptic children (as suggested in one ‚Äúrespected‚Äù Chinese herbal textbook).
I also dispute your claim that my treatments do ‚ÄúNOTHING.‚Äù  I often give exercise instruction and practical dietary advice to my patients, which I hope you do not consider to be without basis.  Also, my acupuncture sometimes seems to have a lasting effect on certain types of pain, particular dermatome-based musculoskeletal syndromes.  Often it appears to be more than a placebo effect, but many of my patients would be happy with the results they get even if it is comparable to a credible placebo.  I try hard to encourage people to seek science-based diagnosis and care, and feel horrible if my services have delayed access to a more appropriate treatment.  I regularly talk people out of trying to self-treat cancers with herbs or buy into the latest fad.
While I understand your criticism about my inclusion of the TCM descriptions on some of the products I carry, I chose to include the manufacturer‚Äôs terminology which is, from what I can tell, legal.  I am competing with sites which categorize things by disease category (i.e. Cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, etc.) and also do illegal medical consults via the internet/phone, which I do not do.  My internet customers are people who are already looking for these products by name, not people looking to self-prescribe using the info I provide.  The fact that the TCM terminology was confusing to you reassures me, though I am considering taking more off my site.
I find your statement that if I‚Äôm an acupuncturist I have to believe in a vitalistic definition of Qi an incorrect oversimplification.  While I spent far too much time and money memorizing esoteric BS and certainly hoped it was at least useful if not true, I no longer think in an astrological/vitalistic model of acupuncture meridians.  To me the best definition of Qi is Oxygen, which fits most of the traditional descriptions (i.e. ‚Äúthe blood carries Qi‚Äù).  Acupuncture produces a local capillary bed dilation, noticeable as a reddened area around the (sterile, single-use, increasingly shallowly inserted) needles.  In addition to the endorphin (and placebo) effect, I feel acupuncture can help release spasmed muscles and thus quickly relieve some types of severe pain.  I regularly use electroacupuncture, which I admit is not traditional acupuncture but is within my scope of practice.  This is an example of how I‚Äôve changed my practice approach based on scientific evidence.  My intent is to provide safe, effective, evidence-based medicine within my scope of practice, and to be honest with my patients when there isn‚Äôt good supporting research.  My income is correspondingly lower than the aggressive chiropractors in town, but that gives me more time to read and write.
The ‚Äúwooist of woo‚Äù is, unfortunately, far worse than I sell.  Homeopathy, Black Salve, Astrological Tuning Forks, Essiac‚Ä¶  The list goes on and on.  Many Chinese herbal formulas are pharmacologically active, and some of them have been found to be relatively safe and effective, particularly for some chronic sub-clinical complaints (such as minor sinus allergies).  I try hard to stay up on issues of toxicity, and pass that info along to inform my patients and customers.  Again, my views have changed over the past few years, and were it easier to shift careers into something more science-based with comparable independence and pay, I‚Äôd likely change.  However, at the risk of a fallacious ‚Äòtu quoque‚Äô argument, when I go to any supermarket pharmacy and see the illegal crap they are selling with impunity (detox foot pads, homeopathic eye drops, Weight Loss 3000, etc.), I realize I‚Äôm not such a demon.  My sales are fairly low, partly because I don‚Äôt overpromote.  Our local Wal-Mart probably sells more fake Hoodia in a year than all my sales combined.
If I abandoned the Chinese Medicine world, it would go on without me.  For now, I‚Äôm working from within to bring a more skeptical, ethical point-of-view about what I see as the worst and best of Chinese medicine.  I am a reasonable scholar of Chinese medical history, Taoist esoteric practice, history of occultism and the New Age movement, and am constantly reframining it in a context of scientific skepticism.  I hope to drag some more minds out of the gutters of Woo Street before I move on.  As an acupuncturist, there is a segment of the population who may listen to me more than they‚Äôd ever listen to Dr. Novella or Dr. Gorski, as some minds are closed to mainstream medicine but look up to CAM artists.  For me however, I am grateful for SBM, JREF, CSICOP, etc. for giving me stimulating reading materials which have made me yearn to be a science-based magician, not a woo-based occultist.
I‚Äôm clearly open to criticism, or I wouldn‚Äôt be posting here.  But to dismiss my world as ‚Äútotal and utter nonsense‚Äù is unlikely to encourage me to consider finer points of persuasive argument.  There are something like 28,000 acupuncturists in the USA now, and there are perhaps 10 who have spoken out critically and skeptically about the delusions and dangers in the TCM world, including Ben Kavoussi, George Ulett, Sabio Lantz, Felix Mann, and me.  That‚Äôs about 0.03%.  You may insult and dismiss me if it helps you avoid cognitive dissonance, but if you help me refine my critical thinking skills, make new observations about science-based medicine, or show some support for my attempts to expose the worst frauds and fallacies in The TCM/CAM world, it will probably reach more people who are making important decisions about their healthcare and sway them in the direction of science and skepticism.

As an acupuncturist, there is a segment of the population who may listen to me more than they&#8217;d ever listen to Dr. Novella or Dr. Gorski, as some minds are closed to mainstream medicine but look up to <abbr title=""Complementary and Alternative Medicine"">CAM</abbr> artists.  For me however, I am grateful for <abbr title=""Science-Based Medicine"">SBM</abbr>, JREF, CSICOP, etc. for giving me stimulating reading materials which have made me yearn to be a science-based magician, not a woo-based occultist.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m clearly open to criticism, or I wouldn&#8217;t be posting here.  But to dismiss my world as &#8220;total and utter nonsense&#8221; is unlikely to encourage me to consider finer points of persuasive argument.  There are something like 28,000 acupuncturists in the USA now, and there are perhaps 10 who have spoken out critically and skeptically about the delusions and dangers in the TCM world, including Ben Kavoussi, George Ulett, Sabio Lantz, Felix Mann, and me.  That&#8217;s about 0.03%.  You may insult and dismiss me if it helps you avoid cognitive dissonance, but if you help me refine my critical thinking skills, make new observations about science-based medicine, or show some support for my attempts to expose the worst frauds and fallacies in The TCM/<abbr title=""Complementary and Alternative Medicine"">CAM</abbr> world, it will probably reach more people who are making important decisions about their healthcare and sway them in the direction of science and skepticism.</p>

Hah! Because there are not healthier ways to improve patient satisfaction? From a patient here‚Äôs a few tips.
-Don‚Äôt hire concentration camp guards to answer your phones and make appointments. (Or give THEM the 1 year prescription for Vicodin)
-Don‚Äôt have the person who leaves snippy notes in the break room saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not your mother, etc‚Äù write the letter that goes out to all new patients.
‚Äì If you give a patient a health history form that takes an hour to fill out, find some way to show that you actually looked at it.
‚Äì If you have a phone system that requires patients to leave a message for test result, refills or to talk to a nurse, makes sure those messages are answered in the time the message states‚Ä¶24 hours usually means 1 day, not 1 week.
‚Äì If your patient is making an effort to be reasonable and polite refrain from rolling your eyes, acting put out, snippy or grumpy. Also refrain from complaining about your staff or the patient‚Äôs other doctor(s) to the patient.
‚Äì Get a computer system where you can share records with other doctors in the area so your patients don‚Äôt have to spend an hour on the phone and another two hours running around town signing forms and collecting films and lab results.
‚Äì keep your computer testing equipment working‚Ä¶or at least advise staff to struggle with software/hardware problems outside the patient‚Äôs sight.
‚Äì Try not to talk to fast.
‚Äì Try not to interrupt more than necessary (yeah, I‚Äôve worked with clients, I understand, sometimes it‚Äôs necessary)
If you are already doing ALL those things, I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôd be ahead of the game in ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù satisfaction surveys. You‚Äôd certainly be doing better than the doctor‚Äôs offices I‚Äôve been to lately.
Of course, the endless supply of Vicodin is probably an easier route to customer satisfaction.

‚Äúbecause of the study defects, we are limited in our conclusions other than that this particular selection of patients did fare rather ‚Äúdisastrously‚Äù when compared to the other groups. Also, since not one of these 32 patients did obviously well with the Gonzales method, it would seem to have no useful effect on patients with this kind and stage of cancer (if not actually harnful).

I will critique your words the way you have been critiquing David‚Äôs:  your use of the word  ‚Äúdisastrously‚Äù will incline your readers to distrust you. You should have simply explained (without any whiff of disdain) that the outcomes seemed to be poorer than the chemo group but only for this one cancer in this one experimental setting that was probably not a credible study because it was flawed for the following reasons‚Ä¶.It doesn‚Äôt rule out the possibility that a select subgroup of pancreatic cancer patients might respond. It doesn‚Äôt rule out the possibility that Gonzalez really does get better results with his patients because of something he does that was not carried out properly in this study. Even if you assume that his results are poorer than he claims for pancreatic cancer, that doesn‚Äôt rule out the possibility that he might get better results with other cancers. There is always room for doubt, so you shouldn‚Äôt come across as dismissive or as rejecting the Gonzalez treatment, or your readers will perceive your words as biased. We shouldn‚Äôt make any sweeping conclusions without more information. We should follow up on all Gonzalez‚Äôs patients to see what can be learned from more data. We should try to learn why patients turn to the Gonzalez regimen and have sympathy and understanding for them. We should admit that some of these patients may have benefitted from the treatment in other ways than in prolongation of life. Gonzalez may be really helping these people in ways that a rigorously scientific mindset doesn‚Äôt recognize. We should not discourage patients from trying it. 
Of course this goes too far. So did you.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of sad that even with all this research done, people wont listen. Do people not like to admit to being wrong or scammed? Does anyone know of any research done on people being lied to, then revealing contradictory statements (which are true) and seeing the retention rate of the lies (or rejection of the truth)? If this has not been done I wonder what are the ethical implication of doing such studies.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs a resource that explores the extent to which people will hold onto ‚Äúmyths‚Äù even when presented with the reality, and methods for breaking through all the misinformation.
