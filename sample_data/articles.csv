// <![CDATA[... <truncated>","<div style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"" class=""sharethis-inline-share-buttons"" ></div><div... <truncated>","{AltHealthWORKS,""Big Phama"",FDA}","<p><span class=""custom_excerpt"">As far as prescription drugs go, few nations are more hopelessly addicted than the United States, where direct-to-viewer TV drug advertising is not only the norm, it makes up huge percentages of national network TV commercials. Surveys show that doctors know far too little about nutrition, and instead rely on prescription drugs as the lifeblood of their practice, even despite the rampant dangers and potential side effects. While these drugs enjoy a sterling a reputation because of their supposed“advanced” nature, the truth is that they are killing Americans in alarmingly high numbers, and there&#8217;s one class of drug in particular that&#8217;s doing most of the damage. &#8220;We Know of No Other Medication&#8230;That Kills Patients So Frequently” As noted in this article from the Organic Consumers Association citing Mercola.com, more Americans now use prescription opioid painkillers than smoke cigarettes, with the U.S. consuming a staggering 80 percent of all opioids sold worldwide. Drug deaths from opioid over-prescription and legal drug abuse are skyrocketing, with 52,404 Americans dying from drug overdoses and 33,091 of these deaths involving at least one opioid. The top killers among this class of drugs include methadone, oxycodone (OxyContin® is one such drug), and hydrocodone (Vicodin®). Prescriptions for this type of drug rose by 300 percent between 2000 and 2009, the article noted, and accounted for nearly-one third of the opioid deaths.  Unfortunately for people consuming these painkillers, the dangers are still not evident, and the way the CDC classify these deaths may be one major reason why. Drug Deaths Not Officially Counted on Top 10 List In summer 2016, a list of the top 10 causes of death in the United States was released by the CDC, with one glaring omission: prescription drugs were not counted in their rightful place of 9th, because of a classification ruling within the organization. As mentioned above, overdoses killed 52,404 people in 2015, the last year for which data has been collected, compared to 48,146 for kidney disease, the “official” ninth-highest cause. One-third of the deaths were from prescribed drugs. While it can be argued that these drugs may deserve to be categorized differently because they are designed to help patients, the cold hard truth of the matter is that prescription drugs kill, and they do so often. “We know of no other medication routinely used for a nonfatal condition that kills patients so frequently,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC. But despite the glaring risks, little is being done to combat the opioid epidemic, perhaps due to the overwhelming influence of the pharmaceutical industry in both politics and the media. In 2015, the industry spent an astonishing $240,651,911 on lobbying — over $81.85 million more than the next highest industry, insurance. Since 1998, pharmaceutical companies have spent more than any other industry on lobbying, more than $1 billion more than the next highest industry (also insurance) according to data from the website OpenSecrets.org. Perhaps the most heartbreaking aspect of the opioid epidemic is that these deaths are preventable, but the first step to preventing them is admitting the problem, and that&#8217;s something most doctors and health professionals — not to mention the CDC — still don&#8217;t seem willing to do. While it&#8217;s true that strong painkillers are necessary for people on the high end of the pain spectrum, others are able to withstand pain through smaller doses of the drugs, natural remedies, and a combination of relaxation, and overall mental strength (“mind over matter”). In the meantime, you can protect yourself from the dangers of opioids by reading up about natural painkiller alternatives both in terms of herbs and practices like meditation, that can be used in concert with each other over time to diminish or eliminate the need for opioids (with the help of a doctor). Recommended Reading: Meditation Could Eliminate Need for Painkillers By Opening a “Completely Different Pathway,” Researchers Say A Survey Was Given to 114 U.S. Doctors About Nutrition. These Results Are Pretty Scary Drug Overdoses Are the 9th Leading Cause of Death in the U.S. (Mercola.com, includes info on pregnancy risks of opioids) &nbsp;</span></p>

"283818","New Study Finds Link Between Autism and Fever During Pregnancy. Could Vaccine Side Effects Be a Contributing Factor?","12364","

// <![CDATA[

// ]]> 

As the current already-... <truncated>","<div style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"" class=""sharethis-inline-share-buttons"" ></div><p><... <truncated>","{autism}","<p><span class=""custom_excerpt"">As the current already-high autism rate of 1-in-45 children continues to slowly grow, there is a growing need to discover the cause, or the many causes contributing to this epidemic. While there is likely a range of contributing factors, many agree that until we find the truth, no study or even small finding should be dismissed. By that token a new study has brought up a surprising point for discussion and future research, showing that women who had fevers during their pregnancies are three times more likely to have children on the autism spectrum. The study, published this month by Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, studied almost 100,000 children in Norway. Roughly 16% of these children were born from mothers who experienced fever during their pregnancies. In this group, there were 583 cases of autism; in total about 3.71% of women who had a fever during pregnancy had a child with autism. The risk of autism, however, increased if the mother had one fever of at least 99 degrees during the second trimester. If the mother had multiple fevers after the twelfth week of pregnancy, the risk of giving birth to a child with autism increased by over 300%. While a 99 degree fever may not seem strikingly high at first glance, it&#8217;s worth noting that Norwegian mothers have likely taken their temperature with a thermometer under the armpit, which is why in some European countries a normal temperature is generally lower — 36.6 degrees Celsius or 97.8 Fahrenheit. What is considered to be a normal temperature in the U.S. — 98.6 F, or 37 C, many find to be abnormal when taken under the armpit. A 99 F or 37.2 C could be a low-grade fever in some parts of Europe. The study found that women who took ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory) to fight these fevers did not have children with autism (an different result than taking acetaminophen, which increased autism risk in one study), although the sample size of this group of women was too small to draw a conclusion. The biggest take-away from this study is as follows: preventing infections as well as inflammatory responses is important in preventing a contributing factor to autism. “Maternal exposure to second-trimester fever was associated with increased autism spectrum disorder risk,” the study’s research team wrote. If fever is a contributor to autism, aside from the thimerosal-discussion, can vaccinations add to the risk of autism simply because one of the potential side effects is fever? Fever as a Side Effect of Vaccinations and Autism Risk Pregnant women are recommended by the CDC the following vaccinations: whooping cough (Pertussis) and a flu shot, plus additional vaccines based on health history. For pregnant women, the whooping cough vaccination is recommended during the third trimester of their pregnancy. The first concern is that it is given roughly around the time the baby’s brain is developing very rapidly, at 28 weeks and after. The vaccine also is not a guaranteed protection – it works against whooping cough about 70% of the time; 30% percent of those vaccinated can still get whooping cough. Another issue is that it is impossible to get just the whooping cough vaccine in the U.S. The whooping cough vaccine is only given together with Tetanus, and Diphtheria (both rare in the U.S.), and it is called Tdap. While a mother might not need or want a vaccine against the other two diseases, a single whooping cough vaccine is not available. This combination of vaccines is capable of causing fever at surprisingly rates. A strong fever over 102 F as a side effect of Tdap affects 1 in 250 adults and 1 in 100 adolescents; a fever over 99 F affects about 1 in 100 adults and 1 in 40 adolescents. While these are not necessarily huge numbers, if further research confirms that fever during pregnancy contributes to the factors leading to autism, the risk of fever through vaccination is a potential complication that should be further studied. Finally, in looking at different Tdap and flu vaccines on the market, it&#8217;s worth noting that some have never been studied for the use of pregnant women. Adacel by Sanofi Pasteur states: “Safety and effectiveness of Adael vaccine has not been evaluated for pregnant women.” Boostix by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals has the same warning. [Further reading: These Drugs May Cause Birth Defects – Were Never Tested for Prenatal Use] &nbsp; Some flu shots have not been evaluated for prenatal use either, yet the CDC recommends them for pregnant women. For Fluarix Trivalent,  Flucelvax (Quadrivalent), FluMist Quadrivalent, Fluvirin, Fluzone Quadrivalent, and FluLaval Quadrivalent, safety has not been established for pregnant women. While Afluria (a flu vaccine) researched its prenatal use, its insert recommends to be closely monitored by a specialist if vaccinated. It also has not been evaluated on nursing mothers. And it’s full of controversial ingredients: many flu vaccines contain formaldehyde, thimerosal, mercury, Ploymyxin (which can cause fever by itself) and other toxins. It&#8217;s this cocktail of ingredients that may be responsible for the fever and other side effects. While fever might be a contributing factor to autism, women have been getting fevers while pregnant all the time, and the autism rates were lower, so it&#8217;s clearly not the only factor. Perhaps, it’s because of the toxic overload on our bodies from our environment that makes fever a risk – putting the body over the limit of its capabilities. At any rate, further research should be done, and will hopefully shed more light on this growing problem in the years to come. Still have questions about vaccines?
